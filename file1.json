(ph = kh v f bm\n\n2.6). this loss can be minimised by using silicon steel material for the construction of core.\n\n(b)\n\neddy current loss: since flux in the core of a transformer is alternating, it links with the magnetic material of the core itself also. this induces an emf in the core and circulates eddy currents. power is required to maintain these eddy currents. this power is dissipated in the form of heat and is known as eddy current loss (pe = ke v f2 t2 b2 m). this loss can be minimised by making the core of thin laminations.\n\nit is already seen in article-8 that the flux set up in the core of the transformer remains constant from no load to full load. hence, iron loss is independent of the load and is known as constant losses.\n\n(ii) copper losses: copper losses occur in both the primary and secondary windings due to their ohmic resistance. if i1, i2 are the primary and secondary currents and r1, r2 are the primary and secondary resistances, respectively.\n\nthen,\n\ntotal copper losses = i r\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1.+ i r\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2.= i rep\n\n1\n\n2\n\n= i res\n\n2\n\n2.the currents in the primary and secondary winding vary according to the load, therefore, these losses vary according to the load and are known as variable loss.\n\nmagnetostriction and its ill effects the property of ferromagnetic materials, due to which their dimensions are changed due to change of magnetic field, is called magnetostriction effect.
