dc electrical power is called a dc generator. the same machine when used to convert dc electrical power into mechanical power, it known as a dc motor. from construction point of view there is no difference between a dc generator and motor.\n\nthe dc motors are very useful where wide range of speeds and perfect speed regulation is required such as electric traction.\n\nchapter\n\n5\n\n396.electrical machines\n\n5.1.dc motor an electro mechanical energy conversion device (electrical machine) that converts dc electrical energy or power (ei) into mechanical energy or power (z t) is called a dc motor.\n\nelectric motors are used for driving industrial machines, e.g., hammers, presses, drilling machines,\n\nlathes, rollers in paper and steel industry, blowers for furnaces, etc., and domestic appliances, e.g.,\n\nrefrigerators, fans, water pumps, toys, mixers, etc. the block diagram of energy conversion, when the electro mechanical device works as a motor, is shown in fig. 5.1.\n\nfig. 5.1 block diagram of electromagnetic energy conversion (motor action)\n\n5.2.working principle of dc motors the operation of a dc motor is based on the principle that when a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, a mechanical force is experienced by it. the direction of this force is determined by fleming's left hand rule and its magnitude is given by the relation:\n\nf = bil newton for simplicity, consider only one coil of the armature placed in the magnetic field produced by a bipolar machine [see fig. 5.2(a)]. when dc supply is connected to the coil, current flows through it which sets up its own field as shown in fig. 5.2(b). by the interaction of the two fields (i.e., field produced by the main poles and the coil), a resultant field is set up as shown in fig. 5.2(c). the tendency of this is to come to its original position i.e., in straight line due to which force is exerted on the two coil sides and torque develops which rotates the coil.\n\nfig. 5.2 working principle of a motor alternately, it can be said that the main poles produce a field fm. its direction is marked in fig.\n\n5.3.when current is supplied to the coil (armature conductors), it produces its own field marked as fr. this field tries to come in line with the main field and an electromagnetic torque develops in clockwise direction as marked in fig. 5.3.\n\ndc motors\n\n397.in actual machine, a large number of conductors are placed on the armature. all the conductors,\n\nplaced under the influence of one pole (say, north pole) carry the current in one direction (outward).\n\nwhereas, the other conductors placed under the influence of other pole i.e., south pole, carry the current in opposite direction as shown in fig. 5.4. a resultant rotor field is produced. its direction is marked by the arrow head fr. this rotor field fr tries to come in line with the main field fm and torque (te) develops. thus, rotor rotates.\n\nfig. 5.3 position of main field fm and rotor field fr fig. 5.4 motor action it can be seen that to obtain a continuous torque, the direction of flow of current in each conductor or coil side must be reversed when it passes through the magnetic neutral axis (mna). this is achieved with the help of a commutator.\n\nfunction of a commutator the function of a commutator in dc motors is to reverse the direction of flow of current in each armature conductor when it passes through the m.n.a. to obtain continuous torque.\n\n5.3.back emf it has been seen that when current is supplied to the armature conductors, as shown in fig. 5.5(a),\n\nplaced in the main magnetic field, torque develops and armature rotates. simultaneously, the armature conductors cut across the magnetic field and an emf is induced in these conductors. the direction of this induced emf in the armature conductors is determined by fleming's right hand rule and is marked in fig. 5.5(b).\n\nfig. 5.5 back emf\n\n398.electrical machines it can be seen that the direction of this induced emf is opposite to the applied voltage. that is why this induced emf is called back emf (eb). the magnitude of this induced emf is given by the relation;\n\neb = pz n a\n\nf\n\n60.or eb = zp a\n\n60.in or eb v\u0003in\n\n(since zp a\n\n60\n\n\u0003are constant) ...(5.1)\n\nalso, n eb\n\nm f shows that speed of motor is inversely proportional to magnetic field or flux.\n\na simple conventional circuit diagram of the machine working as motor, is shown in fig. 5.6. in this case, the supply voltage is always greater than the induced or back emf (i.e., v > eb). therefore, current is always supplied to the motor from the mains and the relation among the various quantities will be; eb = v - ia ra.\n\nsignificance of back emf the current flowing through the armature is given by the relation:\n\nia = v e\n\nr b\n\na\n\n \n\nwhen mechanical load applied on the motor increases, its speed decreases which reduces the value of eb. as a result the value (v - eb) increases which consequently increases ia. hence, motor draws extra current from the mains.\n\nthus, the back emf regulates the input power as per the extra load.\n\n5.4.electro magnetic torque developed in dc motor the electrical power which is supplied to a dc motor is converted into mechanical power. the conversion of power takes place in the armature as stated below:\n\nthe power developed in the armature is given as eia = zte or eia = 2\n\n60.pn te\n\nY=\n\nor f znp ia\n\n60a\n\nY=\n\n= 2\n\n60.pn te\n\nY=\n\nor te = pz n a\n\nf p\n\n2.nm for a particular machine, the number of poles (p), number of conductors per parallel path (z/a)\n\nare constant.\n\n?\n\nt = k f p\n\na i\n\n2.where k = pz a is a constant the constant k for a given machine is the same for the emf equation as well as the torque equation.\n\nas well as, t = k2 i ia where k2 = pz a\n\n2p is another constant or t v\u0003i ia\n\n...(5.2)\n\nfig. 5.6 circuit diagram\n\n(eb < v)\n\ndc motors\n\n399.thus, it is concluded that torque produced in the armature of a dc machine is directly proportional to flux per pole and armature current. moreover, the direction of electromagnetic torque developed in the armature depends upon the direction of flux or magnetic field and the direction of flow of current in the armature conductors. if either of the two is reversed the direction of torque produced is reversed and hence the direction of rotation. but when both are reversed the direction of torque (or rotation)\n\ndoes not change.\n\n5.5.shaft torque in dc motors whole of the electromagnetic torque (te) developed in the armature is not available at the shaft. a part of it is lost to overcome the iron and mechanical (friction and windage) losses.\n\ntherefore, shaft torque (tsh) is somewhat less than the torque developed in the armature.\n\nthus, in case of dc motors, the actual torque available at the shaft for doing useful mechanical work is known as shaft torque.\n\nbrake horse power (b.h.p.)\n\nin case of motors, the mechanical power (h.p.) available at the shaft is known as brake horse power\n\n(b.h.p.). if tsh is the shaft torque in nm and n is speed in rpm then,\n\nuseful output power = z\u0003tsh = 2s n tsh/60 watt output in b.h.p. = 2\n\n60\n\n735.5.p n tsh\n\nY=\n\n.\n\n...(5.3)\n\n5.6.comparison of generator and motor action it has been seen that the same machine can be used as a dc generator or as a dc motor. when it converts mechanical energy (or power) into electrical energy (or power), it is called a dc generator and when it is used for reversed operation, it is called a dc motor.\n\nthe comparison of generator and motor action is given below:\n\ngenerator action motor action fig. 5.7(a) generator fig. 5.7(b) motor\n\n400.electrical machines\n\n1.in generating action, the rotation is due to mechanical torque, therefore, tm and z are in the same direction.\n\n2.the frictional torque tf acts in opposite direction to rotation z.\n\n3.electromagnetic torque te acts in opposite direction to mechanical torque tm so that ztm = zte + ztf.\n\n4.in generating action, an emf is induced in the armature conductors which circulates current in the armature when load is connected to it. hence,\n\ne and i both are in the same direction.\n\n5.in generator action, e > v\n\n6.in generating action, the torque angle t is leading.\n\n7.in generating action, mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.\n\n1.in motoring action, the rotation is due to electromagnetic torque, therefore, te and z are in the same direction.\n\n2.the frictional torque tf acts in opposite direction to rotation z.\n\n3.mechanical torque tm acts in opposite direction to electromagnetic torque te so that zte = ztm + ztf.\n\n4.in motoring action, current is impressed to the armature against the induced emf (e), therefore current flows in opposite direction to that of induced emf.\n\n5.in motor action, e < v\n\n6.in motoring action, the torque angle t is lagging.\n\n7.in motoring action, electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy.\n\nexample 5.1 a 50 hp, 400 v,

while discussing the motor characteristics:\n\neb v\u0003n i\u0003 or n v\u0003 eb f and t v\u0003i\u0003ia\n\n5.9.characteristics of shunt motors the conventional diagram of this motor is shown in fig. 5.13. in these motors, the shunt field current ish = v/rsh remains constant since the supply voltage v is constant. hence, the flux in dc shunt motors is practically constant (although at heavy loads, somewhat flux decreases due to armature reaction).\n\n406.electrical machines\n\n1.n - ia characteristics we know that,\n\nn v\u0003 eb f\n\nsince flux is constant;\n\nn v\u0003eb or n v\u0003v - ia ra if the armature drop (ia ra) is negligible, the speed of the motor will remain constant for all values of load as shown by the dotted line ab in fig. 5.14. but strictly speaking, as the armature current increases due to the increase of load, armature drop ia ra increases and speed of the motor decreases slightly as shown by the straight line a c in fig. 5.14 (neglecting armature reaction). moreover, the characteristic curve does not start from a point of zero armature current because a small current, no load armature current ia0, is necessary to maintain rotation of the motor at no load.\n\nfig. 5.13 circuit for shunt motor fig. 5.14 n ia characteristics of shunt motor since there is no appreciable change in the speed of a dc shunt motor from no load to full load that is why it is considered to be a constant speed motor. this motor is best suited where almost constant speed is required and the load may be thrown off totally and suddenly.\n\n2.t - la characteristics we know that,\n\nt v\u0003i\u0003la since flux is constant,\n\nt v\u0003la hence, the electrical characteristic (i.e., t - ia) is a straight line passing through the origin as shown in fig. 5.15. it is clear from the characteristic curve that a large armature current is required at the start if machine is on heavy load. thus, shunt motor should never be started on load.\n\nfig. 5.15 t-ia characteristics of shunt motor fig. 5.16 n t characteristics of shunt motor dc motors\n\n407\n\n3.n - t characteristics the n - t characteristic is derived from the first two characteristics. when load torque increases,\n\narmature current ia increases but speed decreases slightly. thus with the increase in load or torque, the speed decreases slightly as shown in fig. 5.16.\n\n5.10.characteristics of series motors the conventional diagram a series motor is shown in fig. 5.17. in these motors, the series field winding carries the armature current. therefore, the flux produced by the series field winding is proportional to the armature current before magnetic saturation, but after magnetic saturation flux becomes constant.\n\n1.n - ia characteristics we know that n v\u0003 eb f\n\nwhere, eb = v - ia (ra + rse)\n\nwhen armature current increases, the induced emf (back emf) eb decreases, due to ia (ra + res)\n\ndrop whereas flux i\u0003increases as i\u0003v\u0003ia before magnetic saturation. however, under normal conditions ia (ra\n\n+ rse) drop is quite small and may be neglected.\n\nconsidering eb to be constant,\n\nn v\u0003 1\n\n1.f m ia thus, before magnetic saturation, the n - ia curve follows the hyperbolic path as shown in fig.\n\n5.18.\n\nin this region, the speed decreases abruptly with the increase in load or armature current.\n\nafter magnetic saturation, flux becomes constant, then n v\u0003eb v\u0003v - ia (ra + rse)\n\nthus, after magnetic saturation, the n - ia curve follows a straight line path and speed decreases slightly as shown in fig. 5.18.\n\nfig. 5.17 circuit diagram of series motor fig. 5.18 n ia characteristics of dc series motor\n\n408.electrical machines from this characteristic, it is concluded that the series motor is a variable speed motor, i.e., its speed changes when the armature current (or load) changes. as the load on this motor decreases,\n\nspeed increases. if this motor is connected to the supply without load, armature current will be very small and hence speed will be dangerously high which may damage the motor due to heavy centrifugal forces.\n\ntherefore, a series motor is never started on no load. however, to start a series motor,\n\nmechanical load (not belt driven load because belt slips over the pulley) is put on it first then started.\n\n2.t - ia characteristics we know that,\n\nt v\u0003i\u0003ia in series motors, before magnetic saturation i\u0003v\u0003ia hence, before magnetic saturation the electromagnetic torque produced in the armature is proportional to the square of the armature current. therefore, this portion of the curve (oa) is a parabola passing through the origin as shown in fig. 5.19.\n\nhowever, after magnetic saturation, the flux i\u0003becomes constant.\n\n?\n\nt v\u0003ia hence, after magnetic saturation, the curve (ab) becomes a straight line.\n\nit is seen that before magnetic saturation t v\u0003ia\n\n2.when load is applied to this motor at start, it takes large current and heavy torque is produced which is proportional to square of this current.\n\nthus, this motor is capable to pick up heavy loads at the start and best suited for electric traction.\n\n3.n - t characteristics this characteristic is derived from the first two characteristics. at low value of load, ia is small,\n\ntorque is small but the speed is very high. as load increases, ia increases, torque increases but the speed decreases rapidly. thus for increasing torque, speed decreases rapidly as shown in fig. 5.20.\n\nfig. 5.19 t ia characteristics of dc series motor fig. 5.20 n t characteristics of dc series motor\n\n5.11.characteristics of compound motors there are two types of compound wound dc motors namely; cumulative compound motors and differential compound motors. cumulative compound motors are most common. the characteristics of dc motors\n\n409.these motors lies between the shunt and series motors. the n - ia characteristics, t - ia characteristics and n - t characteristics are shown in figs. 5.21(a), (b) and (c), respectively.\n\nfig. 5.21 characteristics of cumulatively compound dc motor however the n-ia, t-ia and n-t characteristics of a differentially compound motor are shown in figs. 5.22(a), (b) and (c), respectively.\n\nfig. 5.22 characteristics of differentially compound dc motor\n\n5.12.applications and selection of dc motors\n\n\n5.12.1.applications of dc motors\n as per the characteristics of dc motors, different types of dc motors are applied for different jobs as explained below:\n\n1.separately excited motors: very accurate speeds can be obtained by these motors. moreover,\n\nthese motors are best suited where speed variation is required from very low value to high value.\n\nthese motors are used in steel rolling mills, paper mills, diesel - electric propulsion of ships, etc.\n\n2.shunt motors: from the characteristics of a shunt motor we have seen that it is almost constant speed motor. it is, therefore, used;\n\n(i) where the speed between no load to full load has to be maintained almost constant.\n\n(ii) where it is required to drive the load at various speeds (various speeds are obtained by speed control methods) and any one of the speed is required to be maintained almost constant for a relatively long period.\n\n410.electrical machines as such the shunt motors are most suitable for industrial drives such as lathes, drills, grinders,\n\nshapers, spinning and weaving machines, line shafts in the group drive, etc.\n\n3.series motors: the characteristics of a series motor reveal that it is variable speed motor i.e.,\n\nthe speed is low at higher torques and vice versa. moreover, at light loads or at no load, the motor attains dangerously high speed. it is, therefore, employed:\n\n(i) where high torque is required at the time of starting to accelerate heavy loads quickly.\n\n(ii) where the load is subjected to heavy fluctuations and speed is required to be adjusted automatically.\n\nas such the series motors are most suitable for electric traction, cranes, elevators, vacuum cleaners, hair driers, sewing machines, fans and air compressors, etc.\n\nnote: the series motors are always directly coupled with loads or coupled through gears. belt loads are never applied to series motor, because the belt may slip over the pulley or it may break.\n\nthen the motor will operate at light loads or at no load and will attain dangerously high speed which may damage the motor.\n\n4.compound motors: the important characteristic of this motor is that the speed falls appreciably on heavy loads as in a series motor, but at light loads, the maximum speed is limited to safe value. it is, therefore, used;\n\n(i) where high torque is required at the time of starting and where the load may be thrown off suddenly.\n\n(ii) where the load is subjected to heavy fluctuations.\n\nas such the cumulative compound, motors are best suited for punching and shearing machines,\n\nrolling mills, lifts and mine hoists, etc.\n\n\n5.12.2.selection of dc motors\n while selecting a dc motor for a particular work, one is to consider the following points:\n\n1.selection of power rating: if the size (hp or kw capacity) of a motor is more than the load to be picked up by it then it will operate at lighter load than its rating. hence, there will be more losses\n\n(i.e., motor will operate at poor efficiency) and unnecessarily there will be wastage of power. thus extra expenditure will incur during operation. at the same time its initial cost will be more.\n\non the other hand, if the size of the motor is less than the load to be picked up by it, then it will be over loaded and it will be heated up beyond its limits. hence the motor may be damaged if operated continuously. otherwise, also the protective devices will disconnect the motor under over load conditions and this affect the production.\n\nthus, a motor should be chosen of a size for its maximum power utilisation. during operation,\n\nit should be heated up within the permissible temperature limits and it should never be over \n\nheated. but at the same time it should be capable to take up the over loads temporarily.\n\n2.characteristics of the motor: for satisfactory operation, selection of power rating of a motor is not only the criteria, rather one should know the characteristics of a motor (i.e., behaviour of a motor under different load conditions) so that a work can be done quickly and efficiently without any breakdown. therefore, before selection of motor, one should know the following particulars of the work dc motors\n\n411\n\n(i) torque requirement during starting and running at different loads.\n\n(ii) requirement of accelerating and braking torque\n\n(iii) frequency of switching\n\n(iv) temperature at the work place\n\n(v) environmental conditions, etc.\n\nafter knowing the above particulars at the work place, a suitable motor (with proper enclosures)\n\nto meet with the requirements is selected.\n\n5.13.starting of dc motors to start a dc motor, when it is switched-on to the supply with full rated voltage, it draws heavy current during starting period (more than its rated value). this excessive current overheats the armature winding and may even damage the winding insulation. therefore, during starting period a resistance called starter in connected in series with the armature circuit to limit the starting current.\n\n5.14.necessity of starter for a dc motor under normal operating conditions, the voltage equation for a motor is given as eb\n\n= v - iara or iara = v - eb the armature current is given by the relation;\n\nia = v e\n\nr b\n\na\n\n \n\nwhen the motor is at rest, the induced emf eb in the armature is zero (eb v n). consequently, if full voltage is applied across the motor terminals, the armature will draw heavy current (ia = v/ra) because armature resistance is relatively small. this heavy starting current has the following effects :\n\n(i) it will blow out the fuses and prior to that it may damage the insulation of armature winding due to excessive heating effect if starting period is more.\n\n(ii) excessive voltage drop will occur in the lines to which the motor is connected. thus, the operation of the appliances connected to the same line may be impaired and in some cases they may refuse to work.\n\nto avoid this heavy current at start, a variable resistance is connected in series with the armature,\n\nas shown in fig. 5.23, called a starting resistance or starter, and thus the armature current is limited to safe value i v\n\nr r\n\na a\n\n=\n\n+\n\ne\n\ne\n\na\n\n^\n\n-\n\n~ . once the motor picks up speed, emf is built up and current is reduced i\n\nv e\n\nr r\n\na b\n\na\n\n=\n\n \n\n+\n\ne\n\ne\n\na\n\n^\n\n-\n\n~\n\n1\n\n. after that the starting resistance is gradually reduced. ultimately, whole of the resistance is taken out of circuit when the motor attains normal speed.\n\nfig. 5.23 dc shunt motor starter\n\n412.electrical machines another important feature of a starter is that it contains protective devices such as overload protection coil (or relay) which provides necessary protection to the motor against over loading and no volt release coil.\n\n5.15.starters for dc shunt and compound wound motors the basic function of a starter is to limit the current in the armature circuit during starting or accelerating period. starters are always rated on the basis of output power and voltage of the motor with which they are to be employed, e.g., 10 hp, 250 v shunt motor starter). a simplest type of starter is just a variable resistance (a rheostat) connected in series with the armature alone (not with the motor as a whole) as shown in figs. 5.24(a) and (b).\n\nfig. 5.24 dc series and compound motor starter it may be noted that shunt field is kept independent of starting resistance. it is because when supply is connected, it receives normal rated voltage and sets up maximum (rated) flux. a higher value of flux results in a low operating speed and a higher motor torque for a particular value of starting current since speed is inversely proportion to flux per pole n m 1\n\ne\n\ne\n\na\n\n^\n\n-\n\n~\n\nf whereas motor torque is proportional to product of flux per pole and armature current (t v iia). hence, for a given load torque,\n\nthe motor will accelerate quickly and reduces the starting period. thus, the heating effect to armature winding is reduced.\n\nfor all practical application, this starter is further modified which includes protective devices such as over load release and no volt release. the over load release protects the motor against over \n\nloading i.e., when the motor is over loaded (or short circuited) this relay brings the plunger to its off position. on the other hand, the no volt release brings the plunger to its off position so that the motor may not start again without starter. for shunt and compound motors there are two standard types of starters named as (a) three point starter and (b) four point starter.\n\n5.16.three point shunt motor starter the schematic connection diagram of a shunt motor starter is shown in fig. 5.25. it consists of starting resistance r divided into several sections. the tapping points of starting resistance are connected dc motors\n\n413.to number of studs. the last stud of the starting resistance is connected to terminal a to which one terminal of the armature is connected. the + ve supply line is connected to the line terminal l through main switch. from line terminal, supply is connected to the starting lever sl through over load release coil olrc. a spring s is placed over the lever to bring it to the off position, when supply goes off. a soft iron piece si is attached with the starting lever which is pulled by the no volt release coil under normal running condition. the far end of the brass strip bs is connected to the terminal z through a no volt release coil nvrc. one end of the shunt field winding in connected to z terminal of the starter. an iron piece is lifted by olrc under abnormal condition to short circuit the no volt release coil. the negative supply line is connected directly to the other ends of shunt field winding and armature of the dc shunt motor.\n\nfig. 5.25 three point shunt motor starter operation first of all the main switch is closed with starting lever resting in off position. the handle is then turned clockwise to the first stud and brass strip. as soon as it comes in contact with first stud,\n\nwhole of the starting resistance r is inserted in series with the armature and the field winding is directly connected across the supply through brass strip. as the handle is turned further the starting resistance is cut out of the armature circuit in steps and finally entire starting resistance is cut out of armature circuit.\n\nno volt release coil and its function a no volt release coil is a small electromagnet having many turns of fine wire. it is connected in series with shunt field winding and therefore, carries a small field current. when the handle is turned to on position, the no volt release coil is magnetised by the field current and holds the starting lever at on position. in case of failure or disconnection of the supply, this coil is demagnetised and the lever\n\n414.electrical machines comes to the off position due to spring tension. consequently. the motor is disconnected from the supply. if the spring with the no volt release coil is not used the lever would remain in on position in case of supply failure. and again, when the supply comes, the motor would be connected directly to the lines without starter.\n\nthe other important advantage of connecting the no volt release coil in series with the shunt field winding is that due to an accident if the circuit of field winding becomes open, the nvrc will be demagnetised and the starting lever is immediately pulled back to off position by the spring.\n\notherwise the motor would have attained dangerously high speed.\n\nover load release coil and its function an over load release coil is an electromagnet having small number of turns of thick wire. it is connected in series with the motor and carries the line current. when the motor is over loaded (or short circuited), a heavy current more than predetermined value will flow through it. then, the iron piece (armature or plunger) is lifted and short circuits the no volt release coil. hence the starting lever is released and pulled back to the off position due to spring tension. thus the motor is disconnected from the supply and is protected against over loading.\n\n5.17.four point starter for speed control of dc shunt or compound motors, a rheostat (variable resistor rh) is connected in series with the field winding, as shown in fig. 5.26. in this case, if a three point starter is used and the value of rh is so adjusted that the current flowing through the shunt field winding is very small. it may be seen that the same current flows through the no volt release coil, then the magnetic strength of the coil may be insufficient to hold the plunger at its on position. this is an undesirable feature of a three point starter. this feature makes a three point starter unsuitable for such applications.\n\naccordingly, a four point starter is designed, as shown in fig. 5.26, in which the current flowing through the no volt release coil is made independent of the shunt field circuit. figure 5.26(a) shows a four point starter used with a shunt wound motor whereas fig. 5.26(b) shows a starter used with a compound wound machine.\n\noperation the working of a four point starter is similar to a three point starter with slight changes.\n\nin this case, when the plunger touches the first stud, the line current is divided into the following three parts:\n\n(i) first part passes through starting resistance and armature (as well as in series field for compound motors).\n\n(ii) second part passes through the field winding (and speed control resistance if applied) and\n\n(iii) the third part passes through no volt release coil and protective resistance connected in series with the coil.\n\ndc motors\n\n415.fig. 5.26 four point dc motor starter it is evident that is a four point starter, the no volt release coil circuit is independent of the field circuit. therefore, the change of current in the field circuit do not affect the pull exerted by the holding coil which remains always sufficient to prevent the spiral spring from restoring the plunger to its off position.\n\nwhile starting a motor with a four point starter it is necessary to ensure that the field circuit is closed and the rheostat connected in series with the shunt field winding must be at zero resistance position. moreover, whole of the starting resistance must come in series with the armature.\n\nwhenever a shunt motor is required to be stopped, it must be stopped by opening the line switch.\n\nin fact this switch can be opened without any appreciable arc since the motor develops back emf nearly equal to applied voltage and the net voltage across the switch contacts is very small. the electromagnetic energy stored in the field does not appear at the switch but it gradually discharges through the armature. the motor should never be stopped by bringing the plunger (starting arm)\n\nback to the off position, because in such cases, when the field circuit breaks at the last stud placed near the off position, a heavy spark occurs owing to the inductive nature of the field. usually, this sparking burns the contact.\n\nmoreover, while stopping the motor, the value of resistance connected in the field circuit should always be reduced to zero so that speed of motor falls to its normal value. this ensures that, when the motor is started next time, it must start with a strong field and higher starting torque.\n\n416.electrical machines\n\n5.18.calculation of step resistances used in shunt motor starter for starting a motor from stand still to its rated speed, it is normally desirable to increase the speed gradually to maintain the angular acceleration constant during the starting period. the angular acceleration is proportional to the net torque, which is in turn nearly proportional to the product of flux (i) and armature current ia i.e., t v\u0003iia. the flux i\u0003will remain constant provided line voltage remains constant. hence it follows that substantially constant angular acceleration calls for constant armature current during starting period.\n\nwe know,\n\nspeed, n v e v\n\ni r b\n\na f\n\nf\n\nm\n\n \n\nwhere r = resistance of armature plus the resistance of starter.\n\nsince ia and i are to be kept constant, therefore, for increasing the speed (n) gradually, r should be varied (reduced) in such a way that the above relation must be satisfied. for different values of armature current, the value of r is given by the expression, d r = v kn ia\n\n \n\nwhere k is a constant note the steps:\n\nn v v i r a\n\n \n\nf or i\u0003n v v - iar or kn = v - iar or r = v kn ia\n\n \n\nin starters, usually the value of r is changed in steps and, therefore, armature current will change in two extreme values. accordingly, the steps of the starter are designed in such a way that armature current varies in between these limits so that torque may not change to a greater degree.\n\nthe fuse or mcb placed in the motor circuit is usually not larger than 150% of the motor full \n\nload current.\n\nlet i1 and i2 be the maximum and minimum value of the current drawn by the motor during starting. let the starter has n sections each having a resistance as r1, r2, r3...rn as shown in fig. 5.27.\n\nlet the total resistance of armature circuit when the starting arm is kept at stud no. 1, 2, 3, ... n and n + 1 be r1, r2, r3, ...rn and rn+1 (where rn+1 = ra), respectively.\n\nfig. 5.27 design of shunt motor starter dc motors\n\n417.just at the time of starting when the starting arm is brought in contact with stud 1, the motor is

here, for starting the motor, the control arm or plunger is moved in clockwise direction from its off position to on position against the spring tension. in the beginning, all the sections of the starting resistance are connected in series with the armature to limit the current to predetermined value. as the starting arm moves, various steps of the starting resistance are cut out of circuit and dc motors\n\n423.ultimately whole of the starting resistance is cut out and the control arm is held in the on position by an electromagnet. the hold on (no volt release) coil is connected in series with the armature circuit.\n\nif the motor loses its load, current drawn by the motor decreases which decreases the strength of the hold on coil. immediately the arm goes back to the off position due to strong spring tension; thus preventing the motor from over speed. the control arm or plunger also goes back to the off position when supply goes off or when the supply voltage decreases appreciably. l and y are the two points of the starter through which supply line terminal and the motor (series field) terminal is connected.\n\nfor stopping the motor, the line switch should always be opened rather than bringing the control arm back to its off position. if it is done a heavy sparking occurs at the last stud placed near the off position. this sparking occurs due to dissipation of energy stored in the magnetic field of series field winding.\n\nexample 5.17 a 240 v series motor takes 40 a when giving its rated output at 1500 rpm. its armature and series field

answer type questions q.1. how does a dc motor differ from a dc generator in construction?\n\nans. basically, there is no difference in the construction of a dc generator and motor, however the frame of the generator can, as a rule, be open but those of motors should be either partly or totally enclosed.\n\nq.2. why the emf generated in the armature of a dc motor is called the back emf ?\n\nans. because this induced emf in a dc motor opposes the applied voltage, therefore, it is called back or counter emf.\n\nq.3. what do you understand by self excitation mode of dc machine? name two dc machines working in this mode.\n\nans. the dc machine in which field winding(s) is/are excited by the current supplied by the machine itself is said to be in its self excited made. in such machines the field coils are inter connected with the armature winding.\n\nthe self excited machines may be (i) dc shunt machine (ii) dc series machine q.4. what will be the effect on direction of rotation of a dc series motor if the supply terminals are reversed?\n\nans. there will be no effect, motor will rotate in the same direction, as before the reversal of line terminals.\n\nq.5. how can the direction of rotation of a dc shunt motor be reversed?\n\nans. direction of rotation of a dc shunt motor can be reversed by reversing the current flow through either the armature winding or the field winding.\n\nq.6. what do you mean by speed regulation of a dc motor?\n\nans. the speed regulation of a dc motor is defined as the change in speed when the load on the motor is reduced from rated load to zero load and is expressed in percentage of rated full load speed q.7. in a dc motor, the brushes are given a backward shift why?\n\nans. in a dc motor, the brushes are given backward shift to neutralise the effect of armature reaction and further to reduce sparking at the commutator.\n\n426.electrical machines q.8. what should be the location of interpoles in a (i) motor (ii) generator.\n\nans. in case of a motors, the interpoles having the same polarity as that of main poles must be placed behind them, whereas in case of a generators, the interpoles having same polarity as that of the main pole must be placed ahead of them in the direction of rotation.\n\nq.9. why large variable speed dc motors are fitted with compensating windings?\n\nans. to reduce sparking at brushes due to armature reaction.\n\nq.10. why is the starting torque of a dc series motor more than that of a dc shunt motor of the same rating?\n\nans. in case of a dc series motor flux i is directly proportional to armature current ia (before saturation)\n\nand, therefore, torque developed te v\u0003ia\n\n2.while in case of a dc shunt motor torque developed te v ia\n\n(flux being constant). obviously on the basis of the same kw output and speed, a dc series motor develops the torque more than that of a shunt motor. hence, series motors are capable to pick heavy loads at start.\n\nq.11. what would you expect if the field winding of a dc shunt motor gets disconnected while in normal operation?\n\nans. the flux will drop to almost zero value (residual value) and, therefore, the speed will increase to a tremendously high value and the motor may get damaged due to heavy centrifugal forces.\n\nq.12. what is the purpose and location of a series field winding?\n\nans. series field winding is connected in series with the armature and placed over the magnetic pole core to set up necessary flux in the machine for production of torque.\n\nq.13. a dc shunt motor runs away at heavy loads. comment.\n\nans. the field may be weakened, due to armature reaction at heavy loads, to the extent that the motor runs away.\n\nq.14. what is difference between cumulative compound and differential compound wound motors?\n\nans. in cumulative compound wound dc motors, the field produced by series field winding assists the field produced by shunt field winding, whereas in differential compound wound motors series field opposes the shunt field.\n\nq.15. a long shunt dc compound motor is cumulatively compounded. without any change in connection, it is now run as a dc generator. state whether it will now be differentially or cumulatively compounded.\n\nans. when a cumulatively compounded long shunt dc motor is run as a generator, the shunt and series field currents produce flux in opposite directions and thus it will operate as a differentially compounded generator.\n\nq.16. what is the field of application of dc shunt motor and dc series motor.\n\nans. dc shunt motors are almost constant speed motors. these motors develop medium starting torque and their speed can be adjusted by using speed control methods. therefore, shunt motors can be used for the loads which are totally and suddenly thrown off without resulting in excessive speed. being constant speed motors, they are best suited for driving of line shafts, machine lathes, milling machines,\n\nconveyors, fans and for all purposes where constant speed is required.\n\ndc motors\n\n427.dc series motors are variable speed motors. these motors develop large starting torque but attain dangerously high speed on no load. so these motors cannot be operated at no load. series motors are best suited for electric traction, elevators, cranes, vacuum cleaners, sewing machines etc.\n\nq.17. identify suitable dc motors for the following applications:\n\n(a) electric traction (b) vacuum cleaners (c) paper making (d) shearing and punching.\n\nans. (a) dc series motor (b) dc series motor (c) dc cumulative compound motor (d) dc cumulative compound motor.\n\nq.18. what would happen if a dc motor is directly switched on to the supply, without any starter?\n\nans. if a dc motor is directly switched on to the supply, it will draw heavy current (about 10 - 12 times its rated value) which may over heat the motor or damage it, depending upon the starting period.\n\nq.19. why a starter is necessary for a dc motor?\n\nor why starters are used for dc motors.\n\nans. a starter is employed to limit the starting current and provide necessary safety to the motor.\n\nq.20. a dc shunt motor is connected to a three point starter. what would happen if\n\n(i) the starter handle is moved rapidly from off to on' position;\n\n(ii) the field circuit becomes open circuited with the motor running at no load;\n\n(iii) the starter handle is pulled back to stop the motor.\n\nans. (i)\n\nwhen the starter handle is moved rapidly from off' to on' position, the resistance connected in series with the armature is being cut out at a faster rate and the speed of the motor is increased at a slow rate. because of this the armature current will increase to a larger value and the ratio of upper and lower values of currents will not be maintained.\n\n(ii) with the opening of field circuit with motor running at no load, the field current will reduce to zero. so flux collapses and reduced to zero, in the process, the speed of motor will suddenly starts increasing and continue to increase if the supply is not cut off.\n\n(iii) sparking will occur at the last stud due to release of energy stored in the magnetic field of field winding, which may burn it.\n\nq.21. it is desirable that the starting lever of a motor starter should fall back to off position when the power goes off. why?\n\nans. if the starter arm remains in the \"on\" position when supply goes off, then on restoring the power supply, the motor will start without starting resistance. hence, motor will draw heavy current when supply is restored.\n\nq.22. discuss the limitations of a three point starter.\n\nans. in a three point starter, the no volt release coil is connected in series with the shunt field winding. if the field current is decreased to low value for speed control then magnetic strength of the no volt release coil decreases to such an extent that spring tension brings the starting arm back to off position. to overcome this problem a four point starter is used.\n\nq.23. why do you prefer starter to rheostat in starting dc motors?\n\nans. the starter also contains protective devices, such as no volt release, overload release, etc.\n\n428.electrical machines q.24. how does four point dc shunt motor starter differs from three point starter?\n\nans. in a four point starter the circuits of no volt release coil and shunt field are made independent and so the operation of no volt release is not effected due to variations in field current.\n\n5.20.speed control of dc motors the speed of a dc motor is given by the relation n v\u0003 eb f where eb = v - ia ra\n\n?\n\nn v\u0003 v i r a\n\na\n\n \n\nf from the above equation it is clear that the speed of dc motors can be controlled;\n\n1.by varying flux per pole i. this is known as flux or field control method.\n\n2.by varying the armature drop, i.e., by varying the resistance of armature circuit. this is known as armature control method.\n\n3.by varying the applied voltage. this is known as voltage control method.\n\n5.21.speed control of shunt motors\n\n\n5.21.1.field control method\n the speed of a dc motor can be increased by weakening the field and it can be decreased by strengthening the field. in dc shunt motors, the speed adjustments can be made by field control method by employing any one of the following methods:\n\n1.field rheostat control method\n\n2.reluctance control method\n\n3.field voltage control method\n\n1.field rheostat control method. the flux produced by the shunt field winding depends upon the current flowing through it (i.e., i\u0003v\u0003ish and ish =\n\nv rsh\n\ne\n\ne\n\na\n\n^\n\n-\n\n~ . when a variable resistance r is connected in series with the shunt field winding as shown in fig. 5.29(a). the shunt field current i\n\nv r\n\nr sh sh\n\n=\n\n+\n\ne\n\ne\n\na\n\n^\n\n-\n\n~ is reduced and hence the flux i. consequently, the motor runs at a speed higher than the normal speed (since n v\u00031/i), as shown in fig. 5.29(b) the amount of increase in speed depends upon the value of variable resistance r.\n\nthis method is most common since very little power (i2 sh r) is wasted in the shunt field variable resistance due to relatively small value of ish.\n\nin this method speed can be only increased, thus we can obtain speeds above normal. the other limitations and drawbacks of this method are:\n\n(i) speeds below normal cannot be obtained.\n\ndc motors\n\n429\n\n(ii) the speeds above normal can be obtained by weakening the field. the advantage of high speed cannot be considered for increase in power output rather to compensate the power,\n\narmature has to draw extra current from the mains.\n\n(iii) to obtain high speed, the field is very weak, to obtain certain load torque, armature draws extra current which may causes overheating of armature winding; poor commutation and instability.\n\nhence, the high speeds are restricted to certain extent. high speeds are also restricted due to mechanical considerations such as centrifugal forces developing in the armature conductors and friction occurring at the bearings.\n\naccordingly there is a limit to the maximum speed obtainable with this method. it is mainly because of poor communication at weak fluxes. a ratio of maximum to minimum speeds of 6 is fairly common.\n\nfig. 5.29 speed control of dc shunt motor by field control method\n\n2.reluctance control method. the flux or field can also be controlled by controlling the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, but this can only be obtain by employing some special mechanical features which increases the cost of machine. therefore, practically this method is not employed.\n\n3.field voltage control method. the flux or field can also be controlled by supplying variable voltage to the field winding. this can only be achieved by disconnecting the field winding from the armature and supplying variable voltage from some other source. then the motor is treated as separately excited dc motor.\n\n\n5.21.2.armature control method\n in this method, voltage applied to the armature is changed without altering the field current. this cannot be achieved by just changing the common supply voltage because it will also affect the field simultaneously and the combined effect will have little change in the speed of shunt motor. hence, to adjust the speed of dc shunt motors by armature control method, different arrangements are made and the methods are known as:\n\n1.armature resistance control method\n\n2.shunted armature control method\n\n3.armature terminal voltage control method\n\n430.electrical machines\n\n1.armature resistance control method. in a shunt motor, flux is constant when applied terminal voltage and shunt field resistance are constant. therefore, speed of the motor is directly proportional to induced emf (i.e., n\u0003v\u0003eb and eb= v - ia ra). the value of eb depends upon the drop in the armature circuit. when a variable resistance is connected in series with the armature as shown in fig. 5.30(a) the induced emf [eb = v - 1a (ra + r)] is reduced and hence the speed.\n\nthus, the motor runs at a speed lower than the normal speed as shown in fig. 5.30(b).\n\nfig. 5.30 speed control of dc shunt motor by armature control method for a constant load, the armature current remains the same so the input to the motor remains the same but the output decreases in proportion to the speed. therefore, for the loads such as fans and centrifugal pumps where the load torque decreases with the fall in speed, this method of speed control is quite convenient and economical.\n\nby this method, a wide range of speeds (below normal) can be obtained. moreover, motor develops any desired torque over its operating range since torque depends only upon the armature current (flux remaining unchanged). the major advantage of this method is that the speed of the motor can be reduced to any low value and creeping speed (only a few rpm) can be developed so easily, as shown in fig. 5.30(c).\n\nthe major disadvantage of this method of speed control is that there is heavy loss of power in the control rheostat.\n\n2.shunted armature control method. an armature resistance control method is very simple and usually employed when speeds below normal are required. but this method suffers from the drawback that the motor speed changes with every change in load on the machine. it is because the speed variation does not depend only upon the controlling resistance but it also depends upon load current. because of this reason constant speed cannot be obtained in case of rapidly changing loads. to improve the stability, a shunt diverted is used across the armature in addition to series resistance, as shown in fig. 5.31(a). by this arrangement, the changes in armature current due to change in load torque will not be so effective to change the voltage across armature and hence the speed of the motor remains almost constant.\n\nfigure 5.31(b) shows the speed torque characteristics for shunted armature control method.\n\nin this method, the ideal no load speed of the motor (nc0) will be less than that obtained by conventional series resistance method (n0). this difference occur due to the fact that even if no current flows through the motor armature, there is some current in the series resistance and dc motors\n\n431.the diverter. hence, there is some voltage drop in series resistance which reduces the voltage coming across the armature. thus, in this arrangement, the voltage coming across the armature is always less than the supply voltage. whereas in case of conventional series resistance control method, the voltage coming across armature is v. the following three characteristics have been drawn in fig. 5.31(b).\n\n(i) normal speed torque characteristics - curve a.\n\n(ii) speed torque characteristics with conventional series resistance control - curve b\n\n(iii) speed torque characteristics with shunted armature control - curve c.\n\nfig. 5.31 speed control of dc shunt motors by shunted armature control method.\n\n3.armature terminal voltage control method. in this method, speed of a dc shunt motor is changed by changing the voltage applied across the armature. this can be achieved only by providing a separate voltage source. although this method avoids the disadvantages of poor speed regulation and low efficiency, which are the characteristics of armature resistance control method, but it is very expensive and has very high initial cost. it is because an adjustable voltage generator or an adjustable electronic regulator is required to supply variable voltage to the armature. both these machines are very costly.\n\nthis method gives a large range of speeds with any desired number of speed points. it is essentially a constant torque system because the output of the motor decreases with a decrease in applied voltage and a corresponding decrease in speed.\n\n5.22.speed control of separately excited motors sometimes, it is also called an armature voltage control method of a dc shunt motor. in this case, a separate dc source is used to supply power to the armature of dc shunt motor or separately excited motor and the field winding is excited from a different source. the most common and accurate speed control method of separately excited dc motors is ward leonard system as explained below :\n\nward leonard system this system is used to supply variable voltage to the motor. as shown in fig. 5.32, a dc generator g is mechanically coupled with a prime mover pm which rotates the generator at constant speed. the field winding of the dc generator is connected to a constant voltage dc supply line through a field\n\n432.electrical machines regulator and reversing switch. the dc motor m is fed from the generator g and its field winding is connected directly to a constant dc supply line.\n\nfig. 5.32 ward leonard method of speed control of dc motors the voltage of the generator fed to the motor, can be varied from zero to its maximum value by means of its field regulator. by reversing the direction of the field current by means of the reversing switch, the polarity of the generated voltage can be reversed and hence the direction of rotation of motor m. hence,\n\nby this method, the speed and direction of rotation both can be controlled very accurately.\n\nthe capital investment in this system is very high as two extra machines (a generator and a prime mover) are required. this system of speed control is best suited where almost unlimited speed control in either direction of rotation is required, e.g., in steel rolling mills, paper machines, elevators, cranes,\n\ndiesel electric propulsion of ships, etc.\n\n5.23.speed regulation the speed regulation of a dc motor is defined as the change in speed from full load to no load and is expressed as a percentage of the full load speed.\n\n?\n\n% speed regulation = n.l. speed f.l. speed f.l. speed\n\n \n\nY= 100 = n n\n\nn\n\n0\n\n100\n\n \n\nY=\n\n...(5.18)\n\nexample 5.18 the armature resistance of a 220 v dc generator is 0.4 ohm. it is delivering a load of 4 kw at rated terminal voltage now the machine is operated as a motor and draws the same armature current at the same terminal voltage. in this operation, if the flux per pole is increased by 10% what will be the ratio of generator to motor solution:\n\nas a generator;\n\nia1 = il = 4\n\n1000\n\n220\n\nY=\n\n= 18.182 a eg = v + ia1ra = 220 + 18.182 x 0.4 = 227.27 v dc motors\n\n433.as a motor;\n\nia = ia2 = 18.182 a eb = v -

motors can be controlled by any one of the following methods:\n\n(i) armature control method\n\n(ii) field control method\n\n(iii) series - parallel control method\n\n\n5.24.1.armature control method\n by making various adjustments in the armature circuit of a dc series motor its speed can be controlled.\n\naccording to the adjustments made, these methods are knows as;\n\n1.armature series resistance control method\n\n2.shunted armature control method\n\n3.armature terminal voltage control method.\n\n1.armature series resistance control method. in this method, a variable resistance is connected in series with the armature or motor as shown in fig. 5.36(a). if the load and torque developed by the machine is constant, the speed of the motor depends upon back emf i.e., n v eb. when no addition resistance is connected in series with the armature, then eb1 = v - ia (ra + rse).\n\nhowever, when an additional resistance r is connected in series with the armature, then back emf, eb2 = v - ia (ra + rse + r). obviously eb2\n\n< eb1 accordingly n2 < n1. hence, by connecting an additional resistance is series with the armature we can obtain speeds below normal.\n\nthe speed torque characteristics of a dc series motor without additional resistance and with additional series resistance is shown in fig. 5.36(b). the maximum range of speed control of about 3: 1 will be available depending upon the load.\n\nthis is the most common method employed for the speed control of series motors. the power loss in the control resistance for many applications of dc series motors is not too serious, since in these applications the control is utilised for a large portion of time for decreasing the speed under light loads.\n\ndc motors\n\n441.the major applications of this method of speed control are for driving cranes, hoists, trains,\n\netc., because such drives operate intermittently.\n\nfig. 5.36 speed control of dc series motors by armature control method\n\n2.shunt armature control method. in this method,\n\ncombination of a rheostat r2 shunting the armature and a rheostat r1 in series with armature, as shown in fig.\n\n5.37.is used. it provides slow speeds at light loads. this is an arrangement which accomplishes the speed control both by lowering the voltage applied to the armature and by varying the flux. in fact, the voltage applied to the armature terminals is varied by varying series rheostat r1 whereas the exciting current is varied by varying the shunting rheostat r2 keeping the armature current constant.\n\nin this method, by the insertion of armature diverter r2, armature current reduces, then flux i must increase because torque developed (t v ia) by the armature remains the same. this causes increase in current drawn from the supply mains which increases the field and decreases the speed.\n\nthus, by this method, speeds below normal can be obtained. a wide range of speeds below normal can be obtained by taking different ratios of r1 and r2.\n\nthe application of this method is restricted to the places where speed control for short internals is required because this method is not so economical due to considerable power losses in speed controlling resistance.\n\n3.armature terminal voltage control method. in this method, a variable voltage power supply is used to change the supply voltage which changes the speed of a dc series motor. but the cost of such equipment is so high that this method is rarely applied.\n\n\n5.24.2.field control method\n the speed of series motors can be controlled by varying the flux produced by the series field winding.\n\nthe variation of flux can be brought about by anyone of the following ways;\n\nfig. 5.37 circuit diagram for shunted armature control method\n\n442.electrical machines\n\n1.field diverters: in this method, a variable resistance r is connected in parallel with the series field winding as shown in fig. 5.38. its effect is that it diverts the path of the current il drawn by the motor. a part of the current id flows through diverter and the current flowing through the series field winding is reduced which reduces the flux i. consequently, the speed of the motor is increased (n v\u0003i/ i). thus by this method, only speeds above normal can be obtained.\n\n2.armature diverter: in this method, variable resistance r is connected in parallel with the armature is shown in fig. 5.39. its effect is that it diverts the path of the line current il. some of the current id flows through the diverter and reduces the armature current ia. for a given constant load torque, if ia is reduced then i\u0003must increase ( t v\u0003i\u0003ia). this results in increase in current drawn by the motor and a fall in speed (n v\u00031/i). by adjusting the value of diverter resistance, any speed below normal can be obtained by this method.\n\nfig. 5.38 circuit diagram for field divertor method fig. 5.39 circuit diagram for armature diverter\n\n3.tapped field control: in this method, the number of turns of the series field winding can be changed by short circuiting a part of it as shown in fig. 5.40. we know that flux produced by the winding depends upon the ampere turns (i.e., i\u0003v ise x no. of turns). as the number of turns are reduced,\n\nthe speed of the motor is increased (n v\u00031/i). thus, only speeds above normal can be obtained by this method.\n\n\n5.24.3.voltage control method\n in this method, the voltage across the series motors are changed by connecting them in series or in parallel or the combination of both. this in widely used in electric traction.\n\nto explain this method, let us consider only two similar series motors (for simplicity) whose shafts are mechanically coupled. firstly they are connected is series and then in parallel as shown in figs. 5.41(a) and (b), respectively. the current flowing through each motor and the voltage across it is shown in fig. 5.41.\n\nwhen in series:\n\nspeed, n1 v\u0003

disconnected, it continues to run for some time due to inertia. this continuous rotation may cause damage to equipment or to the manufactured product and even loss of human life. therefore, quick stopping of a motor is essential in such cases.\n\nfig. 5.44 circuit diagram\n\n452.electrical machines thus, the method by which an electric motor or drive is brought to rest quickly when load on it is removed and supply is disconnected is called braking.\n\nbraking may be employed to bring the drive to rest or it may be employed to lower down the speed when load is reduced. the device employed for braking has to absorb the kinetic and potential energy of the moving parts.\n\nobjectives of braking while stopping the drive, braking may be used for any one of the following objectives:\n\n(i) reducing the time of stopping i.e., reducing the time of continuous running when drive is switched - off.\n\n(ii) stopping the drive exactly at specified point, e.g., in lifts; for safety reasons, the drive has to be stopped at a specific point.\n\n(iii) for feeding back some of the energy to the supply system.\n\nessential features of braking\n\n(i) it should be quick and reliable in action.\n\n(ii) braking force should be controllable.\n\n(iii) suitable means must be provided for dissipating the stored energy of the rotating parts.\n\n(iv) a failure of any part of the breaking system should result in the application of brakes.\n\nbraking systems broadly, in electric drives, two systems of braking can be applied:\n\n1.mechanical braking: in mechanical braking the stored energy of rotating parts is dissipated in the form of heat where frictional torque acts against the rotation. the motor may be stopped by using a brake shoe or brake band or brake drum.\n\n2.electrical braking: in electrical braking, the kinetic energy of the motor is converted into electrical energy and is dissipated as heat in a resistance or returned to the supply system.\n\nadvantages and disadvantages of electrical braking over mechanical braking before dealing with electric braking, let us try to find out the advantages and disadvantages of electric braking over mechanical braking.\n\nadvantages\n\n(i) saving; no replacement cost: in case of mechanical braking, due to friction there is excessive wear on brake lining which needs frequent and costly replacement. but in electric braking no such replacement is required hence saves money.\n\n(ii) small maintenance cost: in case of mechanical braking there is more wear and tear which increases the maintenance cost. there is no wear and tear in case of electric braking which reduces the maintenance cost to very low value.\n\ndc motors\n\n453\n\n(iii) energy saving: in regenerative braking, a part of energy is returned to the supply this reduces the operating cost. this is only possible in electric braking.\n\n(iv) reliability: in case of mechanical braking, the heat produced at brake blocks may result in failure of brakes. but in case of electric braking, the heat produced does not affect the braking system this improves its reliability.\n\n(v) smooth operation: mechanical braking may produce jerks but electric braking never produces jerks.\n\n(vi) system capacity: by employing electric braking the capacity of the system can be increased by way of higher speeds and handling of heavy loads.\n\ndisadvantages or limitations\n\n(i) it cannot hold the machine or load stationary: in case of electric braking, the driving motor starts working as a generator during braking period. but at stand still the machine (motor) cannot work as generator. therefore, an electric brake can reduce the speed of the machine or load and bring it to almost at stand still condition but it cannot hold it stationary. hence, electric brake alone cannot fulfil the purpose, friction (mechanical) brake is always provided in addition to it.\n\n(ii) cost: addition equipment employed for electric braking increases the cost.\n\n(iii) choice of motor is limited: in case of electric braking system, the motor has to function as a generator and must have suitable braking characteristics. thus, the choice of motor is limited.\n\nelectric braking is superior to mechanical braking since it is much quicker and eliminates the cost of maintenance of mechanical brakes. however, in order to finally bring the motor to a stand still position and hold it there, friction brakes are also essential.\n\n5.26.types of electric braking there are three types of electric braking.\n\n(i) plugging\n\n(ii) rheostatic braking\n\n(iii) regenerative braking.\n\n\n5.26.1.plugging\n this is also called a counter current braking. it is simplest type of braking and involves the reversing of the connections to the armature of the motor so that it tends to run in the reverse direction. in order to stop the machine, a special device must be installed to cut off the supply as soon as it comes to rest. this method can be applied to dc motors, induction motors and synchronous motors. it is particularly suitable where the drive has to be rapidly reversed such as in planning machines, etc.\n\n(a) plugging applied to dc shunt motors: the direction of rotation of dc shunt motor can be reversed by reversing the current flowing through the armature. the expression for the armature current is ia = v e\n\nr b\n\na\n\n \n\n.\n\n454.electrical machines fig. 5.45 plugging with shunt motor during normal running, the back emf eb is opposite to the applied voltage v' but at the instant of reversal a voltage equal to v + eb is impressed across armature. this will cause a great rush of current (almost double the normal) in the armature circuit. to prevent this the starting resistance is reinserted in the circuit as shown in fig. 5.45.\n\n(b) plugging applied to dc series motors: the method is same as in case of dc shunt motor.\n\nthe changeover of connections is shown in fig. 5.46.\n\nfig. 5.46 plugging with series motor in both cases, the motor must be disconnected from the supply when it comes to rest otherwise it may rotate in the opposite direction.\n\n\n5.26.2.rheostatic braking\n this is also called a dynamic braking. with this method of braking the motor is disconnected from the supply and used as a generator driven by the momentum of the equipment to be braked and supplying current to resistance; dc or synchronous motors can be braked in this way. the induction motors, however, require a separate source of dc excitation during this type of braking. this type of braking is applied to different motors as explained below;\n\n(a) dc shunt motors: the armature is disconnected from the supply and a resistance is connected across it, as shown in fig. 5.47(b). the motor then works as a separately excited generator and the braking torque is applied by the current flowing in the resistance as shown in fig. 5.47.\n\ndc motors\n\n455.fig. 5.47 rheostatic braking of shunt motors the magnitude of the braking effect can be controlled by varying either the resistance in the armature circuit or the field current. the braking is not effective if the supply fails during this period.\n\n(b) dc series motors: the motor after being disconnected from the supply mains, works as a self excited series generator. sometimes, in order to build up more field flux the connections of armature are reversed as shown in fig. 5.48(b).\n\nfig. 5.48 rheostatic braking of series motors in such cases if the resistance is above a certain critical value equal to the initial slope of the current voltage characteristics, the machine will not be self excited, therefore, resistance should be low enough.\n\n\n5.26.3.regenerative braking\n this type of braking is mostly employed in electric traction. the kinetic energy of the motor is converted into electrical energy, which is fed back to the supply lines instead of wasting it in a rheostat. this method can be applied to dc motors and induction motors.\n\n(a) dc shunt motors: if the emf generated by the motor is greater than the supply voltage, power will be fed back to the supply. the emf in a shunt motor depends upon the field flux and speed.\n\nduring this type of braking the field is disconnected from the armature and connected to a separate supply as shown in fig. 5.49. the field current is so adjusted that e > v and this is returned to the mains.\n\n456.electrical machines fig. 5.49 regenerative braking with shunt motors alternatively, if the field excitation does not change but the load causes the speed to increase, the induced emf may become more than the supply voltage and power will be fed back to the supply.\n\n(b) dc series motors: regenerative braking cannot be applied to dc series motors in an ordinary way. for regenerative braking, the motor should work as a generator this is achieved by reversing the connections of series field. but even if the field connections are reversed at the exact moment,\n\nthis method would still be not successful, because at the instant of reversal, the emf induced in the motor will be small, so the current will flow through the field winding in wrong direction,\n\nwhich will reverse the field and cause the motor emf to help the supply voltage. this will result in short circuit of supply. due to these complications, this method is not used for common industrial purposes. however, regenerative braking can be applied with series motors used for traction purposes but in this case, either the field windings are modified or the machines are supplied with separate exciting windings.\n\nfig. 5.50 regenerative braking with series motors one method of regenerative braking with series motors is french method. if there is a single series motor, it is provided with one main series field winding and 2 or 3 auxiliary field windings.\n\ndc motors\n\n457.during normal running the main and auxiliary field windings are placed in parallel with each other as shown in fig. 5.50(a). during regenerative braking, the auxiliary windings are placed in series with each other and combination is connected in parallel across the armature and main series field winding as shown in fig. 5.50(b). in this case the machine works as a differentially compound generator and sends back power to supply lines.\n\nin locomotives there are four to six motors and therefore, no auxiliary windings are required.\n\nthe regenerative braking can be applied in this case as shown in fig. 5.51.\n\nfig. 5.51 regenerative braking an alternative method of regenerative braking is applied by using an exciter for controlling the excitation of the field windings during regeneration.\n\nsection practice problems numerical problems\n\n1.a 220 v dc shunt

v, f and bm are the same as above.\n\nthe major part of this loss occurs in the armature core. to minimise this loss, the armature core is laminated into thin sheets (0*3 to 0*5 mm) since this loss is directly proportional to the square of thickness of the laminations.\n\n3.mechanical losses: as the armature of a dc machine is a rotating part, some power is required to overcome:\n\n(i) air friction of rotating armature (windage loss).\n\n(ii) friction at the bearing and friction between brushes and commutator (friction loss).\n\nthese losses are known as mechanical losses. to reduce these losses proper lubrication is done at the bearings.\n\n5.28.constant and variable losses the losses in a dc machine may also be sub divided into two categories, i.e.,\n\n1.constant losses;\n\n2.variable losses.\n\n1.constant losses: the losses in a dc machine which remain the same at all loads are called constant losses. the constant losses in a dc machine are:\n\n(i) iron losses; (ii) mechanical losses; (iii) shunt field copper losses.\n\n2.variable losses: the losses in a dc machine which vary with load are called variable losses.\n\nthe variable losses in a dc machine are:\n\n(i) armature copper loss; (ii) series field copper loss; (iii) interpole winding copper loss.\n\n5.29.stray losses the sum of the iron loss and mechanical loss in a dc machine are known as stray losses i.e.,\n\nstray losses = iron loss + mechanical loss.\n\n462.electrical machines\n\n5.30.power flow diagram\n\n(i) when machine is working as a generation fig. 5.52 power flow diagram (generator action)\n\nthe mechanical power (z tm) is supplied to the generator which is converted into electrical power\n\n(vil). while conversion, various losses occur in the machine. the power flow diagram for a dc generator is shown in fig. 5.52.\n\nfig. 5.53 power flow diagram (motor action)\n\nalthough losses in a dc machine are the same whether it works as a generator or as a motor but the flow of power is opposite. the power flow diagram for a dc motor is shown in fig. 5.53.\n\n5.31.efficiency of a dc machine the ratio of output power to the input power of a dc machine is called its efficiency**.\n\nefficiency, k = output input ;\n\n* the ratio of output to input of a dc motor is called its commercial efficiency, i.e., h = output input . the ratio of mechanical power output to the power developed in the armature is called its mechanical efficiency, i.e., hm\n\n=\n\nmech. power output mech. power developed in the armature the ratio of electrical power developed in the armature to the electrical power input is called electrical efficiency of the motor, i.e., he = power developed in the armature electrical power input\n\n.\n\nalso, commercial efficiency, h = hm x he dc motors\n\n463\n\n(i) when machine is working as a generator power output = vil watt power input = power output + variable losses + constant losses since the shunt field current ish is very small as compared to line current,\n\nwe may consider, il # ia\n\n(neglecting ish)\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0003 ?\n\nvariable losses = i r\n\nl a\n\n2\n\n;

tight them it required.\n\ncheck that all the cover plates and enclosures are clean and correctly in place - if not fix them.\n\n2.electrical maintenance always keep the insulation dry and in good condition for better reliability.\n\n(i) commutator: trouble may be caused due to dirt deposits deposit, of carbon dust in the grooves between segments, rough surface or eccentricity. check for these and clean the commutator surface with a dry soft fluff free cloth if required.\n\n(ii) brushes: trouble may be caused due to less spring tension, wrong brush positioning,\n\ninsufficient contact surface or too short a brush. check for there and do the adjustments or changes as per the need.\n\n492.electrical machines\n\n(iii) winding: trouble may be caused due to deterioration of insulation. check the insulation resistance of armature winding and field winding periodically - if faculty, it should be repaired.\n\n(iv) insulation resistance: the insulation resistance of the whole machine be checked periodically which should not be less than 1 m :. if its value is found to be less than this then the machine should be cleaned and dried.\n\n(v) earthing: outer frame of the motor must be properly earth, the earth resistance should be checked, if found more pour water in earthing pit.\n\n(vi) starter: check the functioning of the starter, its relay must be sensitive enough to protect the machine.\n\n5.39.faults in dc machines in dc machines faults may occur in field windings or in armature winding.\n\n1.faults in field winding: the faults in field winding may be\n\n(a) open circuit fault: check the winding for open circuit, if found faulty, check the opening at the terminals if so tight up the terminals otherwise replace the field winding.\n\n(b) earth fault: check for the earth fault, if found remove it or replace the coil.\n\n(c) short circuit fault: check for the voltage drop in each turn and locate the fault and replace the turn or repair the field winding.\n\n2.faults in armature winding: in armature winding, following faults may develop:\n\n(i) short circuit in coils: the turns placed in the same slot of the armature may get short circuited due to insulation failure between the turns. heavy local current flows and heat is produced. this may lead to open circuit. the heavy current is purely local and it does not over load the brushes.\n\n(ii) open circuit in coils: due to open circuiting of armature coil, half of the armature which carries sound coils carries double the normal current and the other portion carries no current. this produces heavy sparking at the brushes which may damage it. therefore machine has to be stopped and repaired immediately.\n\n(iii) earthed coil: when a coil in the armature comes in direct contact with armature stampings due to insulation rupturing, the fault is called earth fault. if this fault occurs at one place,\n\nthe effect is not that serious but if this fault occurs at two places, the two coils are being short circuited causing a serious short circuit fault which produces heavy sparking due to unbalancing of armature currents.\n\n5.40.trouble shooting in a dc motor for trouble shooting of a dc motor, the following steps are taken:\n\n1.check the fuses.\n\n2.check the electrical connections at the terminals\n\n3.check the wear and tear of the brushes.\n\ndc motors\n\n493\n\n4.check the continuity of field winding.\n\n5.check the armature winding.\n\nsection practice problems numerical problems\n\n1.the field and armature resistance of a 250 v dc shunt generator is 50 ohm and 0.02 ohm respectively.\n\nit delivers 195 a at rated voltage. the iron and friction losses equal 1050 w. find (a) emf generated (b)\n\ncopper losses (c) output of the prime mover (d) commercial, mechanical and electrical efficiencies.\n\n(ans. 254 v; 2050 w; 51.85 kw; 94.11%, 97.975%, 95.96%)\n\n2.a four pole dc shunt motor draws a current of 36 a when connected to 230 v mains and delivering 10 hp.\n\nif armature and field circuit resistances are 0.1 : and 300 : respectively, find the motor current when load is 5 hp. neglect armature reaction effect.\n\n(ans. 19627 a)\n\n3.a 6 pole, 250 v series motor is wave connected. there are 240 slots and each slot has four conductors.\n\nthe flux per pole in 1.75 x 10-2 wb when the motor is taking 80 a. the field resistance is 0.05 :, the armature resistance is 0.1 : and the iron and frictional loss is 0.1 kw. calculate (a) speed (b) bhp (c)\n\nshaft torque (d) the pull in newton at the rim of the pulley of diameter 30 cm.\n\n(ans. 283.3 rpm; 25.75; 638.34 nm; 4255.6 n)\n\n4.in a brake test, a dc shunt motor draws 40 a from a 231 v supply mains. the brake pulley of radius 30 cm had an effective load of 35 kg and the speed was 720 rpm. find the bhp (metric) and the efficiency at the above load.\n\n(ans. 10.56; 84.05%)\n\n5.the field resistance and armature resistance of a 400 v dc shunt motor is 200 ohm and 0.5 ohm respectively. it draws 5 a at no load. what will be its output and efficiency when it draws 50 a from the mains. also find the percentage change in speed from no load to full load.

loss (ii) windage loss q.3. how do the various losses occurring in a dc machine vary with the load?\n\nans. the copper losses occurring in armature windings i.e., series field winding, compensating winding and interpole winding, vary as the square of the load current whereas copper losses occurring in dc shunt field winding is constant. iron and mechanical losses are independent of load and remain constant.\n\nq.4. what are the components of iron loss in dc machine and in which part of the machine it occurs?\n\nans. the components of iron loss are hysteresis and eddy current losses obviously these losses occur in the iron parts of the machine such as armature core, pole shoe, etc.\n\nq.5. how does eddy current losses change if the thickness of laminations is increased ?\n\nans. eddy current loss will increase as the square of the thickness of magnetic material laminations.\n\nq.6. what type of tests are performed to determine efficiency of dc motors?\n\nans. basically, direct, indirect and regenerative tests are performed to determine the efficiency of dc machines.\n\nq.7. can a swinburne's test be applied to a dc series motor? justify.\n\nans. no, swinburne's test is performed at no load and at no load series motors obtain dangerously high speed and gets damaged. therefore, swinburne's test cannot be applied for determining efficiency of dc series motors.\n\nq.8. what is the main drawback of brake test?\n\nans. the output of the motor cannot be measured accurately.\n\nq.9. why constant losses can be considered equal to input to a machine at no load?\n\nans. because at no load variable losses (armature copper losses and losses in series field winding, interpole winding and compensating winding, if any) are negligible owing to very small armature current.\n\nq.10. state the advantages of swinburne's test.\n\nans. advantages of swinburne's test are:\n\n1.very convenient and economical method since power required is very small.\n\n2.stray or constant losses are determined, therefore, efficiency at any desired value of load can be determined.\n\ndc motors\n\n495.q.11. why hopkinson's test is also called the regenerative or back to back test?\n\nans. the motor supplies mechanical power which is used to drive the generator while generator develops electrical power which is sent back to the system and is utilised in driving the dc motor in addition to electrical power drawn from the supply mains.\n\nq.12. what are the possible causes of sparking at brushes?\n\nans. sparking at brushes may occur due

f is the supply frequency and p is the number of poles of the machine.\n\nwhen the machine is to work as a generator, it has to run at synchronous speed (ns) to generate power at certain frequency (f), called power frequency. in india its value is 50 hz, whereas in the usa it is kept at 60 hz.\n\nwhen the machine works as a motor, it can rotate only at synchronous speed (ns) since the magnetic poles are locked with the revolving field. if the machine fails to rotate at synchronous speed, it is palled out of step and stops.\n\nhence, synchronous machine (generator or motor) is a machine which only runs at synchronous speed and maintains the relation;\n\nns = 120 f /p rpm\n\n502.electrical machines\n\n6.2.basic principles a synchronous machine is just an electro mechanical transducer which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy or vice versa. the fundamental phenomenon which make these conversions possible are :\n\n(i) the law of electro magnetic induction and (ii) law of interaction.\n\n(i) law of electromagnetic induction: this relates to the production of emf, i.e., emf is induced in a conductor whenever it cuts across the magnetic field (see fig. 6.1). this is called faraday's first law of electromagnetic induction.\n\n(ii) law of interaction: this law relates to the phenomenon of production of force. or torque i.e.,\n\nwhenever a current carrying conductor is placed in the magnetic field, by the interaction of the magnetic fields produced by the current carrying conductor and the main field, force is exerted on the conductor and torque is developed (see fig. 6.2).\n\nfig. 6.1 generator principle fig. 6.2 motor principle generator action motor action fig. 6.3 generator action fig. 6.4 motor action\n\n1.in generator action, the rotation is due to mechanical torque, therefore, tm and z are in the same direction.\n\n2.the frictional torque tf acts in opposite direction to rotation z.\n\n3.electromagnetic torque te acts in opposite direction to mechanical torque tm so that ztm = zte + ztf.\n\n4.in generator action, an emf is induced in the armature conductors which circulates current in the armature when load is connected to it. hence,\n\ne and i both are in the same direction.\n\n5.in generator action, e > v\n\n6.in generator action, the torque angle t is leading.\n\n7.in generator action, mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.\n\n1.in motoring action, the rotation is due to electro \n\nmagnetic torque, therefore, te and z are in the same direction.\n\n2.the frictional torque tf acts in opposite direction to rotation z.\n\n3.mechanical torque tm acts in opposite direction to electromagnetic torque te so that zte = ztm + ztf.\n\n4.in motoring action, current is impressed to the armature against the induced emf (e), therefore current flows in opposite direction to that of induced emf.\n\n5.in motor action, e < v\n\n6.in motoring action, the torque angle t is lagging.\n\n7.in motoring action, electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n503\n\n6.3.generator and motor action in generator action, an emf is induced in the armature conductors when they cut across the magnetic field. on closing the circuit, current flows through the armature conductors which produces another field. by the interaction of this field and main field a force is exerted on the conductor which acts is opposite direction to that of rotation. it is this force against which the relative motion of conductors has to be maintained by the mechanical power supplied by the prime mover, thus the mechanical power is converted into electrical power.\n\nin motor action, a current is supplied to the machine which flows through the armature conductors.\n\nthe armature conductors produce a field which interacts with the main field. thus, a force is exerted on the conductors and rotation takes place (i.e., torque is developed). once rotation occurs, an emf is induced in the conductors due to relative motion. this emf acts in opposite direction to the flow of current. the flow of current has to be maintained against this emf by applying external voltage source thus electrical power is converted into mechanical power.\n\n6.4.production of sinusoidal alternating emf when a conductor or coil cuts across the magnetic field an emf is induced in it by the phenomenon called electromagnetic induction. this can be achieved either by rotating a coil in the stationary magnetic field or by keeping the coil stationary and rotating the magnetic field. (the magnetic field can be rotated by placing the field winding on the rotating part of the machine).\n\nfor illustration see figs. 6.5(a) and (b), two positions of a coil rotating in a stationary magnetic field are shown. whereas, in figs. 6.5(c) and (d), two positions of a rotating electro magnet in a coil placed on stationary armature are shown. at first instant, the emf induced in the coil is zero since flux cut by the coil is zero. however, at second instant, the emf induced in the coil is maximum (say positive). the two instants t1 and t2 are marked on the wave diagram shown in fig. 6.5(e). in one revolution the induced emf completes one cycle and its wave shape is shown in fig. 6.5(e).\n\nfig. 6.5 (a to d) generation of alternating emf, (e) wave shape of alternating

and armature winding on rotor, but in larger machines, the field winding is placed on the rotor and armature winding is placed on the stator. the rotating field and stationary armature system is preferred over stationary field and rotating armature system.\n\nfollowing are the important advantages of rotating field system over stationary field system:\n\n(i) the armature winding is more complex than the field winding. therefore, it is easy to place armature winding on stationary structure.\n\n(ii) in the modern alternators (synchronous generators), high voltage is generated, therefore, heavy insulation is provided and it is easy to insulate the high voltage winding when it is placed on stationary structure.\n\n(iii) the size of the armature conductors is much more to carry heavy current, therefore, high centrifugal stresses are developed. thus, it is preferred to place them on stationary structure.\n\n(iv) the size of slip rings depends upon the magnitude of flow of current, therefore, it is easy to deliver small current for excitation, through slip rings of smaller size when rotating field system is used.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n505\n\n(v) it is easier to build and properly balance high speed rotors when they carry the lighter field system.\n\n(vi) the weight of rotor is small when field system is provided on rotor and as such friction losses are produced.\n\n(vii) better cooling system can be provided when the armature is kept stationary.\n\n6.7.constructional features of synchronous machines the important parts of a synchronous machine are given below:\n\n1.stator\n\n2.rotor\n\n3.miscellaneous\n\n1.stator: the outer stationary part of the machine is called stator; it has the following important parts:\n\n(i) stator frame: it is the outer body of the machine made of cast iron and it protects the inner parts of the machine. it can be also made of any other strong material since it is not to carry the magnetic field. cast iron is used only because of its high mechanical strength.\n\n(ii) stator core: the stator core is made of silicon steel material. it is made from number of stamping which are insulated from each other. its function is to provide an easy path for the magnetic lines of force and accommodate the stator winding.\n\n(iii) stator winding: slots are cut on the inner periphery of the stator core in which three phase or one phase winding is placed. enamelled copper is used as winding material.\n\n2.rotor: the rotating part of the machine is called rotor. from construction point of view, there are two types of rotors named as\n\n(i) salient pole type rotor; (ii) non salient pole type rotor.\n\n(i) salient pole type rotor: in this case, projected poles are provided on the rotor. the cost of construction of salient pole type rotors is low, moreover sufficient space is available to accommodate field winding but these cannot bear high mechanical stresses at high speeds. therefore, salient pole type construction is suited for medium and low speeds and are usually employed at hydro electric and diesel power plants as synchronous generators. since the speed of these machines (generators)\n\nis quite low, to obtain the required frequency, the machines have large number of poles as shown in figs. 6.7 and 6.8. to accommodate such a large number of poles,\n\nthese machines have larger diameter and small length.\n\nfig. 6.7 salient pole type alternator.\n\n506.electrical machines for a speed of 200 rpm (alternators coupled with water turbines) the diameter of the machines is as large as 14 metre and length is only 1 metre. the salient pole type rotor has the following important parts:\n\nfig. 6.8 parts of rotor of salient pole alternator\n\n(a) spider: spider is made of cast iron to provide an easy path for the magnetic flux. it is keyed to the shaft and at the outer surface, pole core and pole shoe are keyed to it\n\n[see fig. 6.9(a)].\n\n(b) pole core and pole shoe: it is made of laminated sheet material [see figs. 6.8\n\n(b) and 6.9(b)]. pole core provides least reluctance path for the magnetic field and pole shoe distributes the field over the whole periphery uniformly to produce sinusoidal wave form of the generated emf.\n\nfig. 6.9 (a) spider fig. 6.9 (b) pole core pole shoe\n\n(c) field winding or exciting winding: field winding [see fig. 6.8 (c)] is wound on the former and then placed around the pole core. dc supply is given to it through slip synchronous generators or alternators\n\n507.rings. when direct current flows through the field winding, it produces the required magnetic field.\n\n(d) damper winding: at the outermost periphery, holes are provided [see fig. 6.9 (b)] in which copper bars are inserted and short circuited at both the sides by rings forming damper winding.\n\ngenerally, the segments on individual poles are joined together to form common rings resulting in a short circuited squirrel cage winding similar to that used in induction machines with squirrel cage rotors. salient pole machines are frequently provided with a damper winding on the rotor to damp rotor oscillations during transient conditions and to facilitate smooth operation under unbalanced load conditions.\n\nfig. 6.10 salient pole type alternator mounted vertically at hydro electric power plant (half sectional view)\n\nat hydro electric power plants, usually, salient pole type alternators are placed with their shafts in vertical position, as shown in fig. 6.10.\n\n(ii) non salient pole type rotor: a non salient pole alternator is shown in fig. 6.11. in this case, there are no projected poles but the poles are formed by the current flowing through\n\n508.electrical machines the rotor (exciting) winding. non salient pole type construction is suited for the high speeds. the steam turbines rotate at a high speed (3000 rpm). when these turbines are used as prime mover for this machine working as a generator, a small number of poles are required for given frequency. hence, these machines have smaller diameter and larger length. non salient pole type rotors have the following parts:\n\n(a) rotor core: rotor core is made of silicon steel stampings. it is keyed to the shaft. at the outer periphery slots are cut in which exciting coils are placed. it provides an easy path to the magnetic flux.\n\n(b) rotor winding or exciting winding: it is placed in rotor slots and current is passed through the winding in such a way that poles are formed according to the requirement\n\n(see fig. 6.12).\n\nfig. 6.11 non salient pole type alternator fig. 6.12 non salient pole type rotor\n\n3.miscellaneous parts: the following are few important miscellaneous parts;\n\n(i) brushes: brushes are made of carbon and these just slip over the slip rings. dc supply is given to the brushes. from brushes current flows to the slip rings and then to the exciting winding.\n\n(ii) bearings: bearings are provided between the shaft and outer stationary body to reduce the friction. the material used for their construction is high carbon steel.\n\n(iii) shaft: shaft is made of mild steel. mechanical power is taken or given to the machine through shaft.\n\nsome special features of salient and non salient structures usually the salient pole field structure has the following special features:\n\n(i) these are of larger diameter and shorter length.\n\n(ii) usually, 2/3rd of the pole pitch is covered by the pole shoes synchronous generators or alternators\n\n509\n\n(iii) to reduce eddy current losses, the poles are laminated.\n\n(iv) the machine having such structure are employed with hydraulic turbines or with diesel engines which are usually operated at low speeds (100 to 375 rpm)\n\nthe non salient field structure has the following special features.\n\n(i) they are of smaller diameter and of very long axial length.\n\n(ii) robust construction and noiseless operation.\n\n(iii) less windage (air resistance) loss.\n\n(iv) better in dynamic balancing.\n\n(v) high operating speed (3000 rpm).\n\n(vi) nearly sinusoidal flux distribution around the periphery, and therefore, gives a better emf waveform than that obtainable with salient poles field structure.\n\n(vii) there is no need of providing damper windings (except in special cases to assist in synchronising)\n\nbecause the solid field poles themselves act as efficient dampers.\n\nair gap and its significance a very small air gap increases the stray load loss and synchronous reactance xd. a large air gap needs larger excitation current. therefore, a compromise has to be made. generally the ratio of air \n\ngap to the pole pitch is between 0.008 and 0.02.\n\n6.8.excitation systems since the field winding is on rotor, a special arrangement is necessary to connect dc source to the field. in small size synchronous machines, generally the field winding is excited from a separate dc source through sliprings and brushes. sliprings are metal rings completely encircling the shaft of the machine, but insulated from it. a brush rides and slips over each slipring. the positive end of a dc voltage source is connected to one brush and negative end is connected to another brush. in large machines, various schemes are employed to supply dc excitation to the field winding. some of the most important excitation systems are given below:\n\n\n6.8.1.dc exciters\n this is a conventional method of exciting the field windings of synchronous generators. in this method,\n\nthree machines namely pilot exciter, main exciter and the main 3 phase alternator are mechanically coupled and are therefore, driven by the same shaft. the pilot exciter is a dc shunt generator feeding the field winding of a main exciter. the main exciter is a separately excited dc generator which provides the necessary current to the field winding of the main alternator through brushes and slip rings as shown in fig. 6.13.\n\nthis conventional method of excitation suffers from cooling and maintenance problems associated with slip rings, brushes and commutator with the higher rating alternators. the modern excitation systems have been developed by eliminating the sliding contacts and brushes. this has led to develop static and brushless excitation systems.\n\n510.electrical machines fig. 6.13 circuit diagram of dc exciter\n\n\n6.8.2.static excitation system\n in this method, the excitation power for the main alternator field is drawn from output terminals of the main 3 phase alternator itself. for this purpose, a three phase transformer t1 steps down the alternator voltage to the desired value. this three phase voltage is fed to a three phase full wave bridge rectifier using thyristors. the firing angle of these thyristors is controlled by means of a regulator which picks up the signal from alternator terminals through potential transformer pt and current transformer ct as shown in fig. 6.14. the controlled dc power output from thyristor unit is delivered to the field winding of main alternator through brushes and slip rings as shown in fig. 6.14.\n\nfig. 6.14 circuit diagram of a static exciter while initiating the process of static excitation, first of all, field winding is switched on to the battery bank to establish field current in the alternator. the alternator speed is adjusted to rated speed. when the output voltage from alternator is built up sufficiently, the alternator field windings is synchronous generators or alternators\n\n511.disconnected from battery bank and is switched on to the thyristor bridge output. sufficient protection devices are installed in the static excitation scheme for any possible fault in the excitation system.\n\nthe advantages of static excitation are as follows:\n\n1.its response time is very small about 20 m sec.\n\n2.it eliminates the exciter windage loss and commutator, bearing and winding maintenance.\n\n3.as the excitation energy is taken from alternator terminals itself, the excitation voltage is directly proportional to alternator's speed. this improves the overall system performance.\n\n\n6.8.3.brushless excitation system\n figure 6.15 shows a simplified diagram of a brushless excitation system. the excitation system consists of an alternator rectifier main exciter and a pilot exciter (permanent magnet generator pmg).\n\nboth the main exciter and pilot exciter are driven directly from the main shaft. the main exciter has a stationary field and a rotating armature, which is directly connected, through silicon rectifiers s1, to the main alternator field. thus the sliprings and brushes are eliminated. the main exciter's field is fed from a shaft driven pmg, having rotating permanent magnets attached to the shaft and a stationary 3 phase armature. the ac output of pmg is rectified by three phase full wave phase controlled thyristor bridges. the thyristor assembly is usually housed in removable drawers, which can be taken out easily for repair. the thyristor bridges are controlled by a set of dual firing circuits operating in parallel.\n\nfig. 6.15 brushless excitation system for synchronous generator the base excitation is controlled by an input setting to the thyristor gating circuits. this control signal is derived from the pmg via a regulated dc supply, which also serves the regulator logic circuitry. the regulator controls excitation by supplying a buck boost control signal, which adds algebraically to the base setting. the regulator elements also comprise of solid state circuits.\n\nthis excitation system has a short time constant and a response time of less than 0.1 second.\n\n512.electrical machines section practice problems short answer type questions q.1. how will you define a synchronous machine?\n\nans. an ac machine that rotates only at synchronous speed ns is called a synchronous machine. its satisfactory operation depends upon the relation.\n\nns = 120f p\n\nq.2. what is a synchronous motor? state its working principle.\n\nans. an ac machine that converts electrical power or energy into mechanical power or energy and rotates only at synchronous speed is called synchronous motor.\n\nthe basic principle of operation of a synchronous motor is torque development by the alignment of two fields. in this machine the two fields are magnetically locked and rotor is dragged by the stator revolving field.\n\nq.3. broadly, suggest the construction of synchronous machines?\n\nans. usually large size machines have stationary armature and rotating field system because of economy and simple designing.\n\nas for as construction of rotor is concerned, there are two types of synchronous machines namely,\n\n(i) salient pole type\n\n(ii) non salient pole type q.4. what can be the maximum speed of synchronous machines operating at 50 hz?\n\nans. 3000 rpm, since minimum number of poles can be 2 and ns = 120\n\n120\n\n50\n\n2\n\n3000.f p\n\n=\n\nY=\n\n=\n\nrpm.\n\nq.5. which type of rotor is used in high speed alternators?\n\nans. non salient pole type rotors are used in high speed alternators.\n\nq.6. mention the major advantages and disadvantages of salient pole type rotor construction.\n\nans. advantages:\n\n1.these are cheaper in cost in comparison to non salient pole type rotor construction.\n\n2.they provide more space to accommodate field winding disadvantages:\n\nthese cannot be operated at high speeds due to heavy mechanical stresses.\n\nq.7. where do you suggest to apply salient pole type of alternators and non salient pole type of alternators.\n\nans. (i) salient pole type alternators are operated at low speeds and are coupled with water turbines at hydro electric power plants and with diesel engines at diesel power plants. these machines have large number of poles, larger diameter and smaller length.\n\n(ii) non salient pole type alternators are operated at high speeds and are coupled with steam turbines at thermal power plants. these machines have less number of poles, smaller diameter and larger length.\n\nq.8. why are the pole core and pole shoes laminated?\n\nans. to reduce eddy current losses.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n513.q.9. why the core of turbo alternators in long with smaller diameter?\n\nans. the turbo alternators are operated at high speed. they carry less number of poles (only 2 or 4) which can be accommodated in smaller rotor diameter but to produce desired flux for generation of required power, core length has to be increased.\n\nq.10. at what voltage, usually, the field winding of an alternator is excited?\n\nans. 250 v or 125 v dc.\n\nq.11. what are the different methods by which excitation is provided in synchronous machines ?\n\nans. 1. by dc exciters\n\n2.by static excitation system.\n\n3.by brushless excitation system.\n\n6.9.armature winding in the large synchronous machines, stationary part is the armature. on the inner periphery of the stator core, number of slots (mostly open parallel sided slots) are provided. in these slots armature winding is placed.\n\n6.10.types of armature winding various types of winding schemes can be adopted to wound the armature of an alternator, a few of them are given below:\n\n1.single phase and poly phase windings: when only one winding is placed on the armature and only one emf is obtained at the output, winding is called single phase winding.\n\nwhen more than one windings are placed on the armature and emfs induced are more than one,\n\ndisplaced from each other by some angle, the winding is called poly phase winding. mostly three phase winding is provided on the armature.\n\n2.concentrated and distributed windings: when one slot per pole or slots equal to the number of poles are employed, the windings thus obtained are called concentrated windings. such windings give maximum induced emfs for given number of conductors but the wave form of induced emf is not exactly sinusoidal.\n\nwhen number of slots per poles are more than one, the windings thus obtained are called distributed windings. such windings give slightly less than maximum induced emf for a given number of conductors but the wave form of induced emf is more sinusoidal.\n\n3.single layer and double layer windings: when only one coil side is placed in a slot, the winding is called single layer winding. however, when two coil sides are placed in one slot, one over the other, the winding is called double layer winding.\n\n4.full pitched and short pitched windings: when the two coil sides of the same coil are 180 electrical degrees apart, the winding is called full pitch winding. when the two sides of the same coil are less than 180 electrical degrees apart, the winding is called short pitch winding.\n\nthe emf induced in each coil is maximum with full pitch winding scheme is employed whereas\n\n514.electrical machines emf induced in the short pitch winding is less than that. however, short pitch winding is preferred over full pitch winding because of the following reasons:\n\n(i) it decreases the length at the end connections and thus amount of copper required is saved.\n\n(ii) it reduces the slot reactance and thus improves the wave shape of the generated emf, i.e., the generated emf can be made to approximately sinusoidal more easily by properly chording the winding.\n\n(iii) it reduces or eliminates distorting harmonics in the wave form of generated emf the only disadvantage of short pitch winding is that a few more turns are used to obtain the same voltage as it would be induced in full pitch winding.\n\n5.concentric (or spiral), lap and wave windings: when each group of coils under a pole is arranged into a sort of concentric shape i.e., when the current flow is traced through one such properly connected set of coils that the conductors seem to form a spiral around a portion of the core (see fig. 6.16) the winding is called concentric or chain or spiral winding. this type of winding scheme is preferred for large diameter, low speed synchronous machines.\n\nfig. 6.16 concentric winding in the alternators, the lap and wave windings give the same emf as long as the other conditions are the same. in case of lap winding as shown in fig. 6.17, coils or coil sides overlap the other consecutively and connections are made. whereas in wave winding, as shown in fig. 6.18 the coils are always forward connected. the connections of a lap winding are simpler to that of the wave winding, therefore lap winding is exclusively used.\n\nfig. 6.17 lap winding synchronous generators or alternators\n\n515.fig. 6.18 wave winding\n\n6.11.important terms used in armature winding some of the important terms used in the armature winding are given below:\n\n(i) electrical angle: when a conductor passes through a pair of poles, one cycle of emf is induced in it. thus a pair of poles represents an angle of 360 electrical degrees.\n\nthere is a perfect relation between electrical and mechanical angle.\n\nelectrical angle = mechanical angle x pair of poles.\n\n(ii) pole pitch: distance between two neutral axis (or similar points) of adjacent poles is called poles pitch. the pole pitch can be expressed as number of slots per poles or electrical degrees\n\n(i.e., 180deg elect.), refer to fig. 6.20.\n\nif s is the number of slots on the whole periphery of armature and p is the number of poles,\n\nthen,\n\npole pitch = no. of slots per pole = s/p.\n\n(iii) coil: two conductors placed in the two slots displaced by pole pitch (in full pitch winding) or less than pole pitch (in short pitch winding), connected at one side by the end connections form a single turn coil as shown in fig. 6.19(a). when number of turns are connected in series and each side (coil side) is placed in the slot, it is called a multi turn coil as shown in figs. 6.19(b)\n\nand (c). the multi turn coil is shown in fig. 6.19(d) by a single line diagram.\n\nfig. 6.19 single and multi turn coils\n\n516.electrical machines\n\n(iv) coil pitch or coil span: the distance between two active sides of a coil is called coil span. it is expressed in terms of number of slots or electrical degrees. refer to fig. 6.20.\n\nfig. 6.20 distributed winding\n\n(v) slot pitch: the distance between centre points (or similar points) of two consecutive slots or teeth is called slot pitch. it is expressed in electrical degrees. refer to fig. 6.20.\n\nslop pitch, d =\n\n180o\n\nno. of slots/pole\n\n(vi) phase spread: the angle or space of pole face over which coil sides of the same phase are spread is called phase spread, as shown in fig. 6.20. in a distributed winding, the conductors of one phase under one pole are spread in number of slots so that each phase has equal distribution.\n\nin a three phase winding:\n\nphase spread = 180\n\n3\n\n60\n\n=\n\nelectrical degrees or phase spread = no. of slots/pole/phase example 6.1 draw a developed winding diagram for a 4

answer type questions q.1. what do you mean by one phase and three phase winding?\n\nans. when only one winding is placed in the armature and only one emf is obtained at the output, the winding is called a single phase winding.\n\n520.electrical machines fig. 6.24 developed winding diagram of a double layer, full pitch, distributed lap winding for a 3 phase, 4 pole, 48 slot armature fig. 6.25 develop winding diagram of a double layer, short pitch (5/6), distributed lap winding for a 3 phase, 4 pole, 48 slot armature.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n521.when three windings are placed on the armature and three emfs are obtained at the output which are displaced by an angle of 120 degree electrical, the winding is called three phase winding.\n\nq.2. what do you mean by single layer and double layer winding?\n\nans. when only one coil side is placed in a slot, the winding is called single layer winding. however, when two coil sides are placed in one slot, one over the other, the winding is called double layer winding.\n\nq.3. why do we prefer short pitched winding?\n\nans. short pitch winding is preferred over full pitch winding because of the following reasons:\n\n(i) it decreases the length at the end connections and thus amount of copper required is saved.\n\n(ii) it reduces the slot reactance and thus improves the wave shape of the generated emf i.e., the generated emf can be made to approximately sinusoidal more easily by properly chording the winding.\n\n(iii) it reduces or eliminates distorting harmonics in the wave form of generated emf q.4. what is difference between electrical and mechanical angle?\n\nans. a pair of poles represents an angle of 360 electrical degrees but the physical angular displacement i.e.,\n\nmechanical angle depends upon number of poles on the machine. there is a perfect relation between electrical and mechanical angle.\n\nelectrical angle = mechanical angle x pair of poles.\n\n6.12.coil span factor in a full pitch winding the coil span or coil pitch is always equal to the pole pitch which is equal to\n\n180.electrical degrees. when the coil span is less than 180 electrical degrees, the winding is called short pitched or fractional pitch or chorded winding as shown in fig. 6.26.\n\n\n\nfig. 6.26 short pitched winding fig. 6.27 phasor diagram let e' be the induced emf in each of the two sides of the same coil. for a full pitch winding the emf induced in two sides of the coil i.e., oa and ab are 180 electrical degrees apart as shown in fig.\n\n27.however, when the winding is short pitched by an angle e electrical degrees, the emf induced in the two sides of the coil are oa and ac, i.e., (180 - e) electrical degrees apart of shown in fig. 6.27.\n\nfor a full pitch winding,\n\ntotal induced emf in the coil = oa + ab = e + e = 2e\n\n522.electrical machines for a short pitch winding,\n\ntotal, induced emf in the coil = oc = od + dc\n\n= oa cos e/2 + ac cos e/2\n\n(where ad is a on oc)\n\n= e cos e/2 + e cos e/2\n\n= 2 e cos e/2 the ratio of induced emf in a coil when the winding is short pitched to the induced emf in the same coil when it is full pitched is called a coil span factor or pitch factor or chorded factor and it is generally denoted be kc. it is always less than unity.\n\n?\n\ncoil span factor, kc = 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2.e e\n\ncos\n\n/\n\ncos\n\n/\n\nb

lie under a single pole, are placed in several slots, the winding is called distributed winding. a distributed winding is shown in fig.\n\n6.28.in which there are 12 slots per pole for a three phase winding or four slots per pole per phase.\n\nin a distributed winding, the number of coils representing each phase are connected in series and is called a coil group.\n\nfig. 6.28 distributed winding the emfs induced in the conductors lying in two adjacent slots is similar in wave shape and magnitude but there is a phase difference between them. this phase difference is equal to the angular displacement between two adjacent slots, i.e., slot pitch.\n\nfor the winding scheme considered here,\n\nslot pitch =\n\n180\n\nno. of slots/pole electrical degrees = 180\n\n12\n\n15\n\n=\n\n

in a three phase system, there are equal voltages (or emfs) of the same frequency having a phase difference of 120deg. these voltages can be produced by a three phase ac generator having three identical windings (or phases) fixed on the some spindle and displaced by 120deg electrical. when these windings are rotated in a stationary magnetic field as shown in fig. 6.30(a) or when these windings are kept stationary and the magnetic field is rotated [see fig. 6.30(b)], an emf is induced in each winding or phase. these emfs are of same magnetic and frequency but are displaced from one another by 120deg electrical.\n\nconsider three identical coils a1 a2, b1 b2 and c1c2 mounted on the rotor as shown in fig. 6.30\n\n(a) or placed on the stationary armature as shown in fig. 6.30 (b). here, a1, b1 and c1 are the start terminals, whereas, a2, b2 and c2 are finish terminals of three coils. it may be noted that a phase difference of 120deg electrical is maintained between the corresponding start terminals a1, b1 and c1.\n\nlet the three coils mounted on the same axis be rotated (or the magnetic field system be rotated keeping coils stationary) is ant i clockwise direction at z radians/second, as shown in fig. 6.30(a)\n\nand (b) respectively. three emfs are induced in the three coils respectively. their magnitude and direction, at this instant are given below:\n\n(i) the emf induced in coil a1 a2 is zero and is increasing in the positive direction as shown by wave a1 a2 in fig. 6.30(c).\n\n(ii) the coil b1 b2 is 120deg (electrical) behind the coil a1 a2 the emf induced in this coil is negative and is becoming maximum negative as shown by the wave b1 b2 in fig. 6.30(c).\n\n(iii) the coil c1c2 is 120deg (electrical) behind b1 b2 or 240deg (electrical) behind a1 a2 the emf induced in this coil is positive and is decreasing as shown by wave c1 c2 in fig. 6.30(c).\n\nphasor diagram: the emfs induced in three coils are of the same magnitude and frequency but

form the harmonics in the output voltage wave form are developed due to non sinusoidal wave form of the field flux. these are also developed due to variation in the reluctance of the air gap because

its first position.\n\nfig. 6.34 position of resultant field at instant t3'\n\nat this instant, angle t is 270deg, therefore,\n\ni1 = sin 270deg = - im i2 = sin (270deg - 120deg) = 0*5 im i3 = im sin (270 - 240deg) = 0*5 im the three fields, i1, i2 and i3 are shown vectorially in fig. 6.34(b). field i1 is shown in opposite direction. the resultant field ir is the vector sum of i1, i2 and i3. resolving the fields along the axis of field i1.\n\nir = i1 + i2 cos 60deg + i3 cos 60deg\n\nor ir = im + 0*5 im x 0*5 + 0*5 im x 0*5 or ir = 1*5 im hence, in one cycle the resultant field rotates through one revolution. it may also be seen that when supply from three phases 1, 2 and 3 is given to coils a ac, b bc and c cc respectively, an anticlockwise rotating field is produced. if supply to the coils a - ac, b - bc and c - cc is given from phase 1, 3 and\n\n2.respectively, the direction of rotation of the resultant field is reversed.\n\nthus, to reverse the direction of rotation of rotating magnetic field, the connections of any two supply terminals are interchanged.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n539.conclusion hence, it is concluded that when a three phase supply is given to a three phase wound stator of an induction motor or synchronous motor, resultant field fm of magnitude 1*5 im is produced which rotates in space at a constant speed called synchronous speed (ns = 120 f /p). the direction of rotation of the resultant field depends upon the sequence in which supply in given to the stator winding.\n\n6.20.ferrari's principle (vector representation of alternating field)\n\nan alternating field can be represented by two vectors revolving in opposite directions at constant speed of z radians per second. it can be well explained with the help of ferrari's principle.\n\nferrari's principle states that a single alternating magnetic field is the resultant of two fields,\n\neach of half the magnitude of alternating field, rotating in opposite direction at fixed speed, called synchronous speed.\n\nconsider a field im having two components 1 and 2 each of magnitude im/2, which are rotating in oppose direction at a constant angular speed of z radians/sec.\n\nfig. 6.35 two vectors revolving in opposite direction and its wave diagram let at start, the two components are vertically upwards i.e., along the vertical axis and the resultant field is +im. when z = 90deg, the resultant field is zero as shown in fig. 6.35(ii), whereas when i =\n\n180deg the resultant field is -im and so on.\n\nto determine the value of resultant field at any instant (say after t seconds), the two components make an angle i = zt with the reference (vertical) axis then, the resultant field at that instant,\n\ni = im cos zt or ir = im cos t which is an alternating field.\n\n540.electrical machines hence, an alternating field can be represented by two components of field having half the magnitude rotating in opposite direction at a constant speed, called synchronous speed.\n\naccording to ferrari's principle, an alternating field produced by each phase (coil) can be represented by two components of field each having half the magnitude rotating in opposite direction at a constant speed, called synchronous speed.\n\nfig. 6.36 position of the components of the fields at various instants considering a coil a ac having an axis oa. when an alternating supply is given to the coil, an alternating field (i) is produced by the coil as shown in fig. 6.36(a). at an instant t1, the two components of the field 1 and 2 each of magnitude im/2 rotating in opposite direction are represented along the axis of the coil as shown in fig. 6.36(b). at an instant t2, the two components of the field are rotated through 90deg and their position is shown in fig. 6.36(c). similarly at an instant t3 the position of the two components is shown in fig. 6.36(d).\n\n6.21.production of two phase rotating magnetic field considering two coils a ac and b bc having axis oa and ob respectively displaced from each other by 90deg as shown in fig. 6.37(b). when two phase ac supply is given to these coils, each one of them produces alternating field (flux) as shown in fig. 6.37(a). considering an instant t1, flux produced by coil a ac is + im, therefore the component 1 and 2 each of value im/2 are along the axis of coil a ac i.e., oa, as shown in fig. 6.37(b).\n\nthe flux produced by the coil b\n\n bc is zero at this instant and will become + im after a rotation of 90deg. accordingly the position of component 3 and 4 each equal to im/2 is shown in fig. 6.37(b).\n\nat this instant, the component 2 and 4 are equal and opposite and rotating in opposite direction,\n\nthus neutralising each other. the resultant component is the sum of 1 and 3 equal im rotating in anticlockwise direction i.e., the direction of the supply sequence.\n\nthus, it is concluded that when 2 phase supply is applied (or current flows) to a 2 phase wound stator, resultant field of magnitude im is set up which rotates in space at a synchronous speed in the direction of supply sequence.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n541.fig. 6.37 position of the components of the fields at instant t1\n\n6.22.production of three phase rotating magnetic field considering three coils a - ac, b - bc and c - cc having axis oa, ob and oc respectively as shown in fig. 6.38(b). when three phase supply is given to these three coils, each of them produces alternating field (flux) as shown in fig. 6.38(a). considering an instant t1, flux produced by coil a - ac is + im,\n\ntherefore the components 1 and 2 each of value im/2 are long the axis of coil a - ac i.e., oa.\n\nfig. 6.38 resultant magnetic field the flux produced by coil b - bc will become positive maximum (+im) after an angular rotation of 120 electrical degrees. therefore, one of the component (3) of the field produced by this coil,\n\nrotating in anticlockwise direction, at this instant is along the axis of a - ac i.e., oa. whereas, the other component (4), rotating in clockwise direction is along the axis of coil c - cc i.e., oc.\n\nthe flux produced by the coil c - cc will become positive maximum (+im) after an angular rotation of 240 electrical degrees. therefore, one of the component (5), rotating in anticlockwise direction,\n\nat this instant is along the axis of coil a - ac i.e., oa. whereas, the other component (6), rotating in clockwise direction is along the axis of coil b - bc i.e., ob.\n\nthe resultant of the three components 2, 4 and 6, which are rotating in clockwise direction and displaced by an angle of 120 electrical degrees is zero. the resultant of the remaining three components\n\n542.electrical machines\n\n1, 3 and 5 is 1*5 im which is rotating in anticlockwise direction. it is the direction in which the supply is given to the three phases (coils) of the machine.\n\nconclusion hence, it is concluded that when a three phase supply is given to the stator of a three phase wound machine, a resultant field of magnitude 1 * 5 im is produced which rotates in space at a constant speed,\n\ncalled synchronous speed. the direction of rotating of the resultant field depends upon the sequence in which supply is given to the three phases (or coils).\n\n6.23.rating of alternators the rating of all the power apparatus whether mechanical (steam or ic engines) or electrical (electrical machines) depends upon the power which they can handle safely and efficiently under some specific conditions.\n\nelectrical machines or apparatus are usually rated as per the load they can carry without overheating and damaging the insulation. the rating of electrical machines is governed by the temperature rise caused by the internal losses of the machine. the copper loss (i2r), in the armature depends upon the magnitude of current passing through the armature conductors and core loss depends upon the operating voltage. both these losses are independent of the power factor.\n\nthe power in kw is proportional to the power factor of the load which may be different for different loads. for instant, let the rating of an alternator be 1000 kva, at full load it will be in position to deliver 400, 600, 800 and 1000 kw at power factor 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 respectively. at these loads,\n\ncurrent supplied by the alternator will be the same and the losses will also remain the same.\n\nthe above explanation clearly shows that the rating of an alternator depends upon, the maximum current it can deliver without overheating and the voltage for which it is designed. the pf of the load is not considered to give its rating.\n\nhence, alternators are rated in kva and not in kw.\n\nthe electrical machines and apparatus which themselves work as a load like induction motors,\n\novens, heaters, refrigerators, air conditioners, etc., are rated in kw. but the machines which are supplying or transferring electric power like alternators, transformers etc., are rated in kva.\n\n6.24.armature resistance the resistance per phase is armature resistance of an alternator. the resistance of a winding, depending upon resistivity of winding material, length and area of cross section r\n\nl a\n\n=\n\ne\n\ni\n\ni\n\nV\n\n@\n\n.\n\nr is called dc resistance of the winding. the actual or ac resistance in nearly 1*25 to 1*75 times the dc resistance.\n\nthis is because of unequal distribution of alternating current (skin effect) over the cross section of the conductor. voltage drop (ir) occurs in the winding because of this resistance which is in phase with the current phasor. however, the value of this resistance is very small as compared to synchronous synchronous generators or alternators\n\n543.reactance of the machine, which is why, many times, its voltage drop effect is neglected. heavy copper losses occur in the machine because of armature resistance.\n\n6.25.armature leakage reactance when current flows through the armature conductors, local fluxes are set at various places. the flux which links with the armature winding but not with rotor field winding is called leakage flux. the leakage flux may be divided into the following three components:\n\n(i) slot leakage flux: the flux which links or surrounds the armature conductors embedded in the iron or placed in the slots but does not passes through the air gap is called the slots leakage flux as shown in fig. 6.39.\n\n(ii) air gap leakage flux: the flux which surrounds the armature conductors and passes through the air gap (i.e., the flux which crosses from tooth to tooth in the air gap) as shown in fig. 6.39 is called air gap leakage flux.\n\n(iii) end connection leakage flux: the flux which links with only the end connections of the armature winding is called end connection leakage flux. it is also called as an over hang leakage flux.\n\nfig. 6.39 leakage fluxes the total leakage flux which links with the armature winding (conductors) gives rise to inductance.\n\nthe magnitude of the inductance is given as l = fn i\n\nhenry where i is the leakage flux in weber, n is the number of turns and i is the armature current. this inductance l, when multiplied by z gives the leakage reactance xl. hence,\n\nxl = zl = 2s\u0003f l ohm a voltage drop (ixl) occurs in the winding because of this reactance. this voltage drop is in quadrature to the current vector.\n\naccording,\n\ne = v iz v\n\ni r jxl\n\n+\n\n=\n\n+\n\n+\n\n(\n\n)\n\n544.electrical machines\n\n6.26.armature reaction at no load, the only field (mmf) acting in the synchronous machine (alternator) is the main field fm'\n\nproduced by the exciting winding. when load is connected to the alternator, current flows through the armature conductors and produces a field (mmf) called armature field fa. this field affects the main magnetic field fm.\n\nthus, the effect of the armature field on the main magnetic field is known as armature reaction.\n\nthe current flowing through the armature conductors depends upon the power factor of the load.\n\ntherefore, the armature reaction will be studied at three extreme conditions of the p.f., i.e., unity,\n\nzero lagging and zero leading.\n\nat unity power factor consider a two pole alternator with the poles rotating in anticlockwise direction. the three phases are represented by concentric coils a ac, b bc and c cc which are displaced by 120deg electrical from each other. where a, b and c are the start terminals and ac, bc and cc are the finish terminals.\n\nat an instant t1, depending upon the position of the poles, direction of induced emfs in three coils is shown in fig. 6.40(a) and their wave diagrams are shown in fig. 6.40(c) (i.e., vaac, vbbc and vccc).\n\nfig. 6.40 armature reaction at unity of power factor the position of the main magnetic field fm produced by the exciting field coils is shown in fig.\n\n6.40(a) as well as fig. 6.40 (b). when a load of unity power factor is connected to the alternator,\n\ncurrent flows through the coils which is in phase with the induced emf as shown in fig. 6.40(b)\n\nand their wave diagrams are shown in fig. 6.40 (c) (i.e., iaac, ibbc and iccc). a resultant armature field fa is produced by the current carrying armature conductors of magnitude 1*5 im (where im is the maximum value of flux produced by the current flowing through each phase) in the direction as shown in fig. 6.40(b). the two fields mmfs. are shown vectorially in fig. 6.40(d). the armature field fa is perpendicular of the main magnetic field fm and produces cross magnetising effect. it is also clear from the position of the two fields that armature field fa lags behind the main magnetic field fm by 90deg causing the same effect as it is being caused by a pure inductance.\n\nthus, for a non inductive load (at unit p.f.) the effect of armature reaction is cross magnetising i.e., it distorts the main field.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n545.at zero power factor lagging at an instant, t2, depending upon the position of the poles, direction of induced emfs in three coils is shown in fig. 6.41(a). for simplicity, the wave diagram of induced emf in coil a - ac is only shown in fig. 6.41(c). at this instant, induced emf in coil side a' is zero and becoming negative. the position of main magnetic field fm produced by the exciting field coils is shown in fig. 6.41(a) as well as fig. 6.41(b).\n\nfig. 6.41 armature reaction at zero lagging power factor when a pure inductive load at zero p.f. lagging is connected to the alternator, currents will flow through the coils, which lag behind their respective induced emfs by 90deg electrical. the wave diagram for the phase representing coil aac is shown in fig. 6.41(c).\n\naccordingly, the direction of flow of current in various coil is shown in fig. 6.41(b). a resultant armature field fa of magnitude 1*5 im is produced by the current carrying armature conductors in the direction as shown in fig. 6.41(b). the two fields (mmfs.) are shown vectorially in fig. 6.41(d).\n\nthe armature field fa acts in opposite direction to that of main magnetic field im and produces demagnetising effect. it is also clear from the position of the two fields that armature field fa lags behind the main magnetic field fm by 180deg i.e., it lags by 90deg because of a pure inductive load and\n\n90deg because of armature reaction.\n\nthus, with a pure inductive load (at zero p.f. lagging) the effect of armature reaction is demagnetising i.e., it weakness the main field.\n\nat zero power factor leading at an instant t3, depending upon the position of the poles, direction of induced emfs in the three coils is shown in fig. 6.42(a). only wave diagram of induced emf in coil a - ac is shown in fig. 6.42(c). at this instant, induced emf in coilside a' is zero and becoming positive. the position of main magnetic field fm produced by the exciting field coils is shown in fig. 6.42(a) as well as 6.42(b).\n\nwhen a pure capacitive load at zero p.f. leading is connected to the alternator, currents will flow through the coils which leads their respective induced emfs by 90deg electrical. the wave diagram for the phase representing coil a ac is shown in fig. 6.42(c).\n\naccordingly, the direction of flow of current in various coils is shown in fig. 6.42(b). a resultant armature field fa of magnitude 1*5 im is produced as shown in fig. 6.42(b). the two fields (mmfs.)\n\nare shown vectorially in fig. 6.42(d). the armature field fa acts in the same direction as that of the main magnetic field fm and produces magnetising effect. it is also clear from the position of the two\n\n546.electrical machines fields that the armature field fa is in phase with the main magnetic field fm. in fact, the armature field was to lead the main field by 90deg due capacitive load but it falls back to its original position due to armature reaction. hence, the armature field acts in phase with the main field.\n\nfig. 6.42 armature reaction at zero leading power factor thus, with a pure capacitive load (at zero p.f. leading) the effect of armature reaction is magnetising i.e., it strengthens the main field.\n\nconclusion the above explanation reveals that\n\n1.the armature reaction flux (ia = 1.5 iarm) is constant in magnitude and rotates at synchronous speed.\n\n2.when generator supplies a load at unity pf, the armature reaction is cross magnetising.\n\n3.when generator supplies a load at zero pf lagging, the armature reaction in demagnetising.\n\n4.when generator supplies a load at zero pf leading, the armature reaction is magnetising.\n\n5.in all the cases, if the armature reaction flux is assumed to act independently of the main field flux, it induces voltage in each phase which lags the respective phase current by 90deg. hence armature reaction causes an armature reactance drop.\n\n6.27.effect of armature reaction on emf of alternator to see the effect of armature reaction on the emf induced in the alternator.\n\nlet, e0 = emf induced per phase by the main field (flux) at no load.\n\nea = emf induced per phase by the armature field (flux).\n\ne = net emf induced per phase i.e., resultant of e0 and ea.\n\n?\n\ne = e ea\n\n0.+\n\nwhen the armature is at no load, no current flows through the armature. thus the armature field is zero. the main field fm (or im) will induce an emf e0 which lags behind im by 90deg as shown in\n\n6.43.therefore, net induced emf e = e0.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n547.when a non inductive load is connected to the alternator, current (i) flows through the armature conductors which is in phase with e0 and produces an armature field fa or ia which lags behind the main field by 90deg. an emf ea is induced by this field which lags behind the armature field by 90deg as shown in fig. 6.44. thus a resultant emf e is obtained across the armature. e e\n\nea\n\n=\n\n+\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0.fig. 6.43 phasor diagram at no load fig. 6.44 phasor diagram for unity p.f.\n\nwhen a pure inductive load is connected to the alternator, a current (i) flows through the armature conductors which lags behind e0 by 90deg. this current produces armature field ia which further induces an emf ea in the armature lagging behind ia by 90deg as shown in fig. 6.45. thus a resultant emf (e = e0 - ea) is obtained across the armature.\n\nwhen a pure capacitive load is connected to the alternator, a current (i) flows through the armature conductors which leads the emf e0 by 90deg. this current produces armature field ia which further induces emf ea in the armature lagging behind ia by 90deg but in phase with e0 as shown in fig. 6.46.\n\nthus, a resultant emf (e = e0 + ea) is obtained across the armature.\n\nfig. 6.45 phasor diagram for zero lagging pf fig. 6.46 phasor diagram for zero loading conclusion from the above discussion, it is concluded that e0 is always in phase quadrature with the load current i and proportional to it. it, therefore, resembles with the emf induced in an inductive reactance so that the effect of armature reaction is exactly as if the stator winding has a reactance xa = ea/i. whereas xa is termed as armature reaction reactance.\n\n548.electrical machines thus, an armature reaction produces a reactance effect in the armature winding called armature reaction reactance.\n\n6.28.synchronous reactance and synchronous impedance synchronous reactance: it is fictitious reactance which has the effect equivalent to the combined effects of both the leakage reactance and armature reaction reactance. it is represented by xs.\n\nxs = xl + xa synchronous impedance: the vector sum of armature resistance and synchronous reactance is known as

synchronous reactance,\n\nthe terminal voltage of synchronous generator depends upon the load and its p.f.\n\nthe rise in terminal voltage when the given load is thrown off, the excitation and speed remaining constant, is called the voltage regulation of a synchronous generator (alternator).\n\nif e0 = no load terminal voltage and v = terminal voltage at a given load.\n\nthen voltage regulation =

voltage when the load is thrown off (removed). however, in case of leading p.f. the terminal voltage may fall when the load is thrown off. therefore, at leading p.f. voltage regulation may be negative.\n\n552.electrical machines the voltage regulation may be zero, when load and its pf may be such that\n\n*ir cos i = ixs sin i the voltage regulation of a synchronous generator is usually much high than that of power transformer because of large amount of voltage drop in synchronous reactance.\n\n6.32.determination of voltage regulation to determine the voltage regulation of smooth cylindrical rotor type alternators, the following methods may be used:\n\n1.direct load test 2. indirect method\n\n1.direct load test: direct load test is performed only on small alternators (say 5 kva). in this case, the alternator is run at synchronous speed with the help of a prime moves and its terminal voltage is adjusted to its rated value v and the load is varied until the ammeter and wattmeter indicate the rated values at given power factor.\n\nthen the load is removed keeping the speed and field excitation constant. at open circuit i.e.,\n\nat no load, the terminal voltage e0 is recorded. then voltage regulation is determined as under:\n\npercentage voltage regulation = e v\n\nv\n\n0\n\n100\n\n \n\nY=\n\n2.indirect method: for large size alternator, indirect methods are used

to determine synchronous reactance, armature resistance is measured by ammeter voltmeter method.\n\nby using these parameters, the regulation of the alternator can be determined at any load.\n\n\n6.33.1.determination of synchronous impedance\n to determine the value of synchronous impedance of an alternator experimentally, the following two tests are performed on the machine:\n\n(i) open circuit test (ii) short circuit test.\n\n(i) open circuit test: to perform open circuit test, the terminals of the alternator are kept open and is rotated by the prime mover at synchronous speed. a dc supply is given to the field winding through a rheostat. a voltmeter is connected across the terminals of the alternator to measure open circuit voltage e and an ammeter is connected in the field circuit to measure field current if as shown in fig. 6.50. the field current if (excitation) is gradually varied (increased in steps)\n\nand the voltage across the terminals of the alternator e is recorded for every change in the field current. a graph is plotted taking if along abscissa and e along the ordinate called open circuit characteristics (o.c.c.). the o.c.c. curve so obtained is shown in fig. 6.52. the curve rises steeply and then flattened due to saturation of the magnetic circuit.\n\nfig. 6.50 circuit diagram for open circuit test on single and three phase alternators note: in case of three phase star connected alternator, to plot the curve phase value of the terminal voltage e = el/\n\n3.is to be considered.\n\n(ii) short circuit test: to perform short circuit test, the terminals of the alternator are short circuited by a thick strip or an ammeter as shown in fig. 6.51. and its rotor is rotated by the prime mover at synchronous speed. the field current if is gradually increased and the short circuit current isc is recorded for every change in the field current with the help of ammeter connected across the alternator terminals. a graph is plotted taking if along abscissa and isc along with ordinate called short circuit characteristics (s.c.c.). the s.c.c. curve so obtained is shown in fig. 6.52 which is almost a straight line.\n\nit should be noted that both the o.c.c. and s.c.c. curves are drawn on a common field current if as shown in fig. 6.52.\n\n554.electrical machines fig. 6.51 circuit diagram for short circuit test on single and three phase alternators fig. 6.52 open circuit and short circuit characteristics determination of synchronous impedance to determine synchronous impedance of the alternator, let oa be the extension (field current if). for this field current oa, open circuit voltage is ab (i.e., e) and for the same field current the short circuit current is ac (i.e., isc). when the alternator is short circuited terminal voltage is zero. therefore, at short circuit, whole of the induced voltage e is being utilised for circulating the short circuit current isc through the synchronous impedance zs.\n\n?\n\ne = isczs or zs = e isc\n\n= open circuit voltage short circuit current at the same field current.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n555.the value of synchronous impedance is not constant. its value is slightly high at low magnetic saturation. an approximate graph of zs against field current. if is drawn by the dotted line as shown in fig. 6.52.\n\nnote: the value of synchronous impedance is usually determined at the field current which provides the rated emf of the machine\n\n\n6.33.2.determination of synchronous reactance\n to determine the value of synchronous reactance, first of all armature resistance is calculated by voltmeter-ammeter method, circuit shown in fig. 6.53. since the value of armature resistance is very small, a low dc supply voltage is connected across the terminals of a one phase alternator. the value of armature resistance r v\n\ni dc dc dc\n\n=\n\ne\n\ne\n\na\n\n^\n\n-\n\n~ is the dc resistance. the actual resistance of the armature of an alternator is 1.25 to 1.75 times to that of dc resistance.\n\nfig. 6.53 voltmeter-ammeter test to determine armature resistance therefore,\n\nr = 1.25 rdc now synchronous reactance,\n\nxs =\n\n(\n\n)\n\n( )\n\nz r\n\ns\n\n2\n\n2\n\n \n\nimp. note: in case of three phase, star connected alternators, dc source, ammeter and voltmeter are connected across the terminals, then the measured resistance comes out to be the resistance of two phases.\n\ndc resistance per phase,\n\nrdc = measured resistance\n\n2.also, all the vector diagrams are drawn considering the phase quantities whether the alternator is single phase or three phase. to determine the regulation, all the quantities must be phase value.\n\n556.electrical machines\n\n6.34.modern alternators when the terminals of the alternator are short circuited due to any fault (short circuit fault) short circuit current isc flows through the armature conductors. this current depends upon the induced emf e0 and the synchronous impedance zs of the alternator i.e.,\n\nisc = e zs\n\n0..\n\nthis short circuit current may damage the armature winding of the alternator if zs is very small.\n\ntherefore, to limit the short circuit current, the modern alternators are designed for higher synchronous impedance. the resistance cannot be increased because it would increase the losses in the machine.\n\nthus modern alternator are designed for higher synchronous reactance (or leakage reactance) but smaller resistance.\n\nthe value of synchronous reactance is some times more than 20 times the armature resistance.\n\ntherefore, for all practical purposes the voltage drop due to armature resistance is neglected as compared to voltage drop due to synchronous reactance.\n\n6.35.short circuit ratio (scr)\n\nthe ratio of field current to produce rated voltage on open circuit to the field current required to circulate rated current on short circuit while the machine is driven at synchronous speed is called short circuit ratio (scr) of a synchronous machine.\n\nfrom occ and scc shown in fig. 6.54.\n\nfig, 6.54 occ and scc for an alternator synchronous generators or alternators\n\n557.short circuit ratio, scr =\n\ni i\n\noa od f\n\nf\n\n1\n\n2\n\n=\n\n= ae dc ae ab ab ae\n\n=\n\n=\n\n1\n\n/\n\nwhere ab ae =\n\nper unit voltage on open circuit corresponding per unit current on short circuit = xs\n\n?\u0003\n\nscr = 1 xs thus, scr is just reciprocal of per unit synchronous reactance xs of the machine. the value of synchronous reactance depends upon saturated conditions of the machine whereas, scr is specific and defined at rated voltage.\n\nsignificance of scr smaller is the value of scr, larger is the value of synchronous reactance which limits the short circuit current to smaller value. but it causes difficulty during parallel operation of the machines owing to smaller value of synchronising power.\n\nlarger value of scr increases the stability of the machine and improves its voltage regulation.\n\nusually, the scr of a high speed non salient pole alternators lies between 0.5 and 0.75 whereas it lies between 1.0 and 1.5 for low speed salient pole type alternators.\n\ntherefore, the salient pole type alternators are more stable than non salient pole type alternators.\n\nexample 6.16 a 1 phase 60 kva, 220 v, 50 hz, alternator has an effective armature leakage reactance of 0*07

machine?\n\nans. operation of synchronous machines: a synchronous machine may operate independently or in parallel with other machines. accordingly, their operation is called;\n\n(i) first mode of operation: the mode of operation in which a synchronous machine works independently is called its first mode of operation. in this case, machine works only as a generator.\n\n(ii) second mode of operation: the mode of operation in which a synchronous machine works in parallel with other machines or connected to the infinite bus bars is called second mode of operation. in this case, a machine may work as a generator or motor.\n\nq.2. what is armature leakage reactance?\n\nans. due to leakage fluxes like slot leakage flux, air gap leakage flux, end connection leakage flux etc., the armature winding has some inductance (l) in each phase which offers leakage reactance (xl = 2s f l)\n\nand is called armature leakage reactance.\n\nq.3. what do you mean by armature reaction reactance?\n\nans. in fact, in synchronous generators the armature reaction produces the same effect as if a reactance is connected in series with the winding and hence is called armature reaction reactance.\n\n566.electrical machines q.4. write down the expression for no load terminal voltage for resistive, inductive and capacitive load.\n\nans. expression for no load terminal voltage for

synchronous impedance: it is determined by performing open circuit and short circuit test on the alternators.\n\nby performing open circuit test, a curve between field current (if) and open circuit voltage or induced emf (e phase value) is drawn.\n\nby performing short circuit test, a curve between field current (if) and short circuit current (isc - phase value) is drawn.\n\nthen, synchronous impedance, zs = e isc at the same if.\n\nq.6. name different methods used to determine voltage regulation of an alternator.\n\nans. voltage regulation of an alternator can be determined by the following methods:\n\n(i) synchronous impedance method or emf method.\n\n(ii) ampere turn method or mmf method\n\n(iii) zero power factor method or potier method.\n\n6.36.assumptions made in synchronous impedance method the following assumptions are made in synchronous impedance method:\n\n1.the synchronous impedance is considered to be constant.\n\nin fact, it is constant only when occ an scc are straight line. but above the knee point of occ,\n\nwhen the saturation starts, the value of synchronous impedance starts decreasing. hence, the synchronous impedance obtained under test conditions is usually larger than actual value. this is the major source of error of determining voltage regulation of an alternator by synchronous impedance method.\n\n2.the flux under test conditions is considered to be the same as that under load conditions.\n\nthe same value of field current is not producing the same flux always. when the armature is short circuited, the armature current lags behind the generated voltage by almost 90deg, hence armature reaction produces demagnetising effect. this reduces the degree of saturation further.\n\nthe actual resultant flux is reduced which reduces the generated emf. these conditions are different from those when the machine is actually loaded. hence, the synchronous impedance obtained under test condition is usually larger than actual value. this causes a source of error while determining voltage regulation of an alternator by this method.\n\n3.the effect of armature reaction flux is usually replaced by a voltage drop proportional to the armature current.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n567.this assumption also causes errors because the shift of armature flux varies with the power factor and the load current.\n\n4.the magnetic reluctance to the armature flux is considered to be constant regardless of the power factor.\n\nalthough, this assumption is substantially true for non salient pole type alternators because air gap in these machines is uniform. but in case of salient pole type alternators, the position of armature flux relative to field poles varies with the power factor. this assumption also introduces considerable error.\n\nhence, it is found that the regulation determined by using synchronous impedance method is higher than the actual value.\n\n6.37.ampere turn (or mmf) method the synchronous impedance method is based on the concept of replacing the effect of armature reaction by a fictitious reactance. accordingly, some assumptions were made. but due to those assumptions, the voltage regulation obtained by that method was higher than the actual value.\n\nin ampere turn or mmf method, the effect of armature leakage reactance is to be replaced by an equivalent additional armature reaction mmf. this additional mmf is combined with the armature reaction mmf.\n\nto determine the regulation of an alternator by mmf method, the following information is required.\n\n(i) the resistance of the stator winding per phase.\n\n(ii) open circuit characteristics at synchronous speed.\n\n(iii) short circuit characteristics.\n\nall these informations can be obtained by performing the same tests as preformed in emf method i.e., open circuit test, short circuit test and ammeter-voltmeter method for finding armature resistance.\n\nthe open circuit and short circuit characteristics are shown in fig. 6.54, where field current if1; is determined to give rated voltage v on no load, neglecting armature resistance drop, the field current if2 is determined to cause short circuit current, equal to full load current, on short circuit.\n\non short circuit, the field excitation if2, bal ances the impedance drop in addition to arma ture reaction on full load. but, as we know that r is usually very small and xl is also small for low voltage on short circuit, so impedance drop can be neglected. hence pf on short circuit is almost zero lagging and the field amp turns are used entirely to over come the armature reaction. therefore, if2, gives demagnetising amp turns at full load.\n\nnow, let us consider that the alternator is supplying full load cur rent at a pf of cos i. draw a line oa representing if1 to give full load rated voltage, v [actually it is equal to v + i r cos i] as shown in fig. 6.55. then draw ab at an angle (90deg +- i) representing if2 to give full load current on short circuit; + ve sign for lagging pf and ve sign for leading pf. now find field current if measuring ob,\n\nwhich will give open circuit emf e0, which can be determined from occ.\n\nthen percentage regulation can be determined from the relation,\n\n% regulation = e v\n\nv\n\n0\n\n100\n\n \n\nY=\n\n.\n\n568.electrical machines fig. 6.55 phasor diagram at

(or emf) method and ampere turn (or mmf)\n\nmethod is based on the total synchronous reactance i.e., (the sum of reactance due to armature leakage flux and due to armature reaction effect). this introduces error due to vectorial addition of magnetic fluxes. whereas, the zero power factor method is based on the separation of reactances due to leakage flux and that due to armature reaction flux, therefore, it gives more accurate results.\n\nfor determining voltage regulation by this method, the following data is required:\n\n(i) effective resistance of armature winding\n\n(ii) open circuit characteristic\n\n(iii) field current to circulate full load current in the stator and\n\n(iv) zero power factor full load voltage characteristic--a curve plotted between terminal voltage and field current while the machine is being running on synchronous speed and delivering full load current at zero power factor.\n\nthe first three requirements can be fulfilled by performing open circuit test, short circuit test and resistance measurement test, as discussed earlier. the curve of zero power factor characteristic can be obtained by taking various steps as explained below:\n\n1.the machine is rotated at rated synchronous speed by a prime mover.\n\n2.a pure inductive load (variable load reactors or an under excited synchronous motor) is connected across the armature terminals and the excitation or field current of the alternator is raised so as to cause flow of full load armature current.\n\nusually, the alternator is loaded by an under excited synchronous motor while plotting zero pf full load curve.\n\n3.the value of the reactance is then increased step by step in such a way that the excitation current is adjusted to a value that causes full load rated armature current to flow. in the process,\n\nthe armature terminal voltages are varied from 125 % to 25 % of the rated voltage in steps,\n\nmaintaining the speed and rated armature current constant throughout the test.\n\n4.note down the armature terminal voltages and excitation currents at each step.\n\n5.draw a curve between terminal voltage and excitation current, as shown in fig. 6.66. it gives the zero power factor (lagging) characteristic.\n\nnow, the zero power factor (lagging) characteristic can be used for obtaining the potier reactance,\n\nit is sufficient to determine the point representing rated armature current and rated voltage. this is indicated by point b in fig. 6.66.\n\nfrom occ and zero power factor curve, it reveals that there is a definite relationship between the zero power factor (lagging) characteristic and an open circuit character istic of an alternator. the zero power factor characteristic curve is of exactly the same shape, as that of occ but it is shifted vertically downward by leakage reactance drop i xl and horizontally, by the armature reaction mmf.\n\nzero power factor full load voltage excitation character istic can be drawn by knowing two points a and b. point a is obtained from a short circuit test with full load armature current. hence oa represents excitation (field current) required to overcome demagnetising effect of armature reaction and to balance leakage reactance drop at full load. point b is obtained when full load current flows through the armature but wattmeter reads zero.\n\n580.electrical machines fig. 6.66 occ of the alternator with zero pf full load curve from point b, line bc is drawn equal and parallel to ao. then a line is drawn through c parallel to initial straight part of occ (parallel to extended og), intersecting the occ at d. bd is joined and a perpendicular df is dropped on bc. the triangle bfd is imposed at various points of occ to obtain corresponding points on the zero factor curve.\n\nin triangle bdf the length bf represents armature reaction excitation and the length df represents leakage reactance drop (i xl)*. this is known as potier reactance voltage drop and the triangle is known as potier triangle. the potier reactance is given, as xp = df (voltage drop per phase)\n\nzero power current per phase it is observed that in case of cylindrical rotor machines, potier reactance is nearly equal to armature leakage reactance, but in case of salient pole machines, the magnetising circuit is more saturated and the armature leakage reactance is smaller than the potier reactance.\n\npotier regulation diagram to determine voltage regulation, potier regulation diagram is drawn as follows:\n\n(i) ov is drawn horizontally to represent terminal voltage, v on full load and oi is drawn to represent full load current at a given power factor. (say lagging).\n\n(ii) draw ve perpendicular to phasor oi and equal to reactance drop (ixl), neglecting resistance drop.\n\n(iii) join oe, where oe represents generated emf e.\n\n(iv) from occ find field excitation if1 corresponding to generated emf e.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n581\n\n(v) draw oa = if1 perpendicular to phasor oe to represent excitation required to induce emf oe on open circuit.\n\n(vi) draw ab = if2 parallel to load current phasor oi to represent excitation equivalent to full load armature reaction.\n\n(vii) join ob = if which gives total excitation required. if the load is thrown off, then terminal voltage will be equal to generated emf corresponding to field excitation ob = if .\n\nhence, emf e0 may be determined from occ corresponding to field excitation ob = if. where,\n\nthe phasor e0 will lag behind phasor ob by 90deg. here, ee0 represents voltage drop due to armature reaction. now regulation can be obtained from the relation.\n\n% regulation = e v\n\nv\n\n0\n\n100\n\n \n\nY=\n\nfig. 6.67 phasor diagram example 6.29 the following test results were obtained when these were performed on a 15 mva,\n\n11.kv, three phase, 50 hz, star connected alternator:\n\nfield at per pole in thousand\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n18\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50.open circuit line emf in kv\n\n2.9\n\n5.0\n\n7.0\n\n8.1\n\n10.0.11.1\n\n11.9.12.7 13.3 13.65 full load current, zero power factor test, line pd in kv\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n0\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n10.0\n\n--\n\nfind the armature reaction ampere turns, the leakage reactance and the regulation for full load at\n\n0.8.pf lagging. neglect resistance.\n\nsolution:\n\nfrom the given data, draw occ between phase voltage and field current. full load zero power factor curve is drawn, taking point a (18, 0) and point b (45, 10 2\n\n3\n\n. ) being known. from the triangle bdf drawn in fig. 6.68.\n\narmature reaction ampere turns = bf = 15000 at/pole.

spective of the rotor position. the effect of armature reaction, fluxes and voltages induced can, therefore, be treated in a simple way with concept of a synchronous reactance and taking it as constant for all positions of field poles with respect to the armature. but in case of\n\n598.electrical machines a salient pole synchronous machine, the air gap is non uniform due to which its reactance varies with the rotor position. therefore, a salient pole machine possesses two axes of geometric symmetry\n\n(i) field pole axis, called direct axis or d axis and\n\n(ii) axis passing through the centres of the inter polar space, called the quadra ture axis or q axis,\n\nthese axes are shown in fig. 6.80. in case of a cylindrical rotor machines, there is only one axis of symmetry (pole axis or direct axis).\n\nquadrature or q axis direct or d axis\n\n+ + + +\n\n+\n\n+\n\nn s\n\no\n\nfig. 6.80 representation of d axis and q axis thus, for salient pole machines, the reluctance of the magnetic paths on which the induced emf depends, acts differently along the direct axis and quadrature axis. the reluctance of the direct axis magnetic circuit is due to yoke and teeth of the stator, air gap, and pole shoe and core of the rotor. in quadrature axis, the reluctance is mainly due to large air gap in the interpolar space.\n\nthus it is observed that because of non uniformity of the reluctance of the magnetic paths, the mmf of the armature is divided into two components namely:\n\n(i) a direct acting component and (ii) a quadrature (or cross) component.\n\nwe have seen that when armature current is in phase with the excitation voltage e the entire mmf of the armature acts at right angles to the axis of the salient poles and, therefore, all the armature mmf is in quadrature. but, if the armature current is in quadrature with the excitation voltage e, the entire mmf of the armature acts directly along the magnetic axis of the salient poles. hence, all of the armature mmf is either added or subtracted from the mmf of the salient pole field. however when the phase difference between armature current and excitation voltage, is of some angle in between 0 and 90deg, the armature mmf will have both a direct acting and a quadrature component. the direct \n\nacting component is proportional to the sine of the phase angle between the armature current and excitation voltage, whereas the quadra ture (or cross) component is proportional to the cosine of the phase angle between the armature current and the excita tion voltage.\n\nthe two reactance concept is similar to the synchronous impedance concept where the effect of arma ture reaction is taken into account by means of equivalent armature reactance voltage. since,\n\nthere is difference in the reluctance of the magnetic paths upon which the two components of the armature mmf act, the value of the equivalent reactance for the direct component of armature mmf synchronous generators or alternators\n\n599.is greater than the value of the equivalent reactance for the quadrature component of the armature mmf. thus the two reactance concept for salient pole machines replaces the effect of armature reaction by two fictitious voltages. these reactance voltages are respectively id xad and iqxaq, where id and iq are the components of the armature current along direct and quadrature axis respectively.\n\neach of these components of armature current also, produce a leakage reactance voltage caused by the armature leakage flux. however, the armature leakage reactance exists is assumed to have the same value xl for both components of the armature current, therefore, synchronous reactance for each component of the armature mmf is as follows:\n\nsynchronous reactance for direct axis,\n\nxd = xad + xl synchronous reactance for quadrature axis,\n\nxq = xaq + xl the voltage equation for each phase of the armature based on the two reactance concept,\n\nv = e i\n\ni x i x r\n\nd d\n\nq q\n\n0. \n\n \n\n \n\nusually, for salient pole synchronous machines xq = 0.6 to 0.7 times xd whereas in cylindrical rotor machines xq = xd\n\n\n6.40.1.determination of xd and xq by low voltage slip test\n to determine the value of xd and xq. a low voltage slip test is performed on the machine, as described below:\n\nstep i: the circuit is arranged as shown in fig. 6.81.\n\nfig. 6.81 circuit for low voltage test step ii: a three phase balanced reduced voltage (say v volt) is applied to the stator winding of the unexcited machine operating at a speed little less than its synchronous speed (slip being less than 1%).\n\nstep iii: using oscillographs, measure and draw the wave shapes of the voltage applied across armature winding, current flowing through it and the voltage induced in the field winding (see fig.\n\n6.82)\n\ntheory: when low voltage v is applied to the stator winding, a current i flows through it which produces stator mmf. this stator mmf moves slowly relative to the poles and induces an emf in the circuit at slip frequency.\n\n600.electrical machines when the axis of the poles and axis of the armature reaction mmf wave coincide, the armature mmf acts through the field magnetic circuit. the voltage applied to the armature is then equal to drop caused by the direct component of armature reaction reactance and leakage reactance.\n\nfig. 6.82 wave diagrams for applied voltage and armature current when the armature reaction mmf is in quadrature with the field poles, the applied voltage is equal to the leakage reactance drop plus the equivalent voltage drop of the corresponding field component.\n\naccordingly, the value xd and xq is determined from the oscillograph record as mentioned below :\n\nxd = maximum voltage minimum current and xq = minimum voltage maximum current\n\n6.41.construction of phasor diagram for two reac tion concept to construct the phasor diagram for two reaction concept, the values of xd and xq must be known.\n\nthe following steps are used in sequence to draw a phasor diagram:\n\n(i) taking voltage phasor as a reference vector, the current phasor oi is drawn lagging behind the voltage vector by an angle i depending upon the load conditions as shown in fig. 6.83.\n\nfig. 6.83 phasor diagram of a salient pole alternator synchronous generators or alternators\n\n601\n\n(ii) from the extreme point of the voltage phasor a line parallel to current phasor oi and equal to ir is drawn.\n\n(iii) from the extreme point of the phasor ir a line perpendicular to current phasor oi and equal to ixq is drawn\n\n(iv) draw a line from the origin o passing through the extreme point of ixq phasor. this line gives the direction of excitation voltage e0.\n\n(v) knowing the direction of e0 the currents ld and iq are drawn and their values are determined.\n\n(vi) from extreme point of vector ir, draw a vector idxd perpendicular to id and iqxq from the extreme point of vector idxd, as shown in fig. 6.83, perpendicular to iq.\n\n(vii) by adding vectorially idxd and iq xq to extremity of phasor ir, the magnitude of excitation voltage e0 is determined.\n\nthe angle t between e0 and i is called the internal power factor angle whereas, the angle g\u0003\n\nbetween e0 and v is called the load or power angle.\n\nthe phasor diagram is redrawn in fig. 6.84 taking e0 in horizontal direction.\n\nfrom

circuiting is quite extensive and beyond the scope of this book. however, we shall limit our discussions regarding this phenomena to the extent that how to determine the short circuit transient currents and the reactance that limit these currents.\n\nthe analysis of transients depends upon two fundamental facts i.e.,\n\n(i) the current in an inductive circuit cannot change instantly and\n\n(ii) the theory of constant flux linkages which states that flux linkages cannot change with a closed ci rcuit having zero resistance and no source.\n\n612.electrical machines consider a three phase alternator running at synchronous speed with its dc field excitation,\n\nwithout any load. when a short circuit occurs at its terminals, the resulting currents in the three phases will develop as shown in fig. 6.91.\n\nfig. 6.91 wave diagram of currents on the three phases the armature current in each phase has an ac as well as dc component. the ac component corresponds to the armature current required to oppose the time varying flux produced by the field winding as it rotates and the dc component corresponds to the initial flux linkages exist at the instant of short circuit. the net resultant of these currents produces the armature flux linkages. each phase of armature keeps its initial flux linkages constant. the similar effects occur in the rotor field winding and these actions occur simultaneously.\n\nmost of the synchronous machines have damper winding which has resistance, self inductance and mutual inductance with respect to armature and field windings. this winding also affects the short circuit currents.\n\nthe transient conditions (currents) do not remain indefinitely. these tend to decay due to resistance of armature and field winding, as shown in fig. 6.92.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n613.fig. 6.92 symmetrical short circuit stator current in synchronous machine as the voltage at the three phases are 120deg out of phase, the short circuit occur at different voltages at the three phases. accordingly the ac component of currents, at the instant of short circuit, is different in each phase. as a result the dc component of armature current is also different in each phase. the total initial current in about 1.5 times ac component of current.\n\nas shown in fig. 6.92, the ac component of current can be divided into three distinct periods\n\n(i) subtransient period: during one cycle or so, the ac current is very large and falls very rapidly.\n\nthis period of time is called subtransient period and the rms value of ac current flowing during this period is called sub transient current (is). this current is developed due to the effect of both damper and field winding. it falls quickly with a time constant tds\n\n(ii) transient period: after sub transient period, the current continues to fall but at slow rate till it attains a steady value. this period of slow decay is called transient period and the rms value of ac current during this period is called transient current (ic). it is caused in the field winding at the instant of short circuit. the time constant of transient period (tdc) is much longer (nearly\n\n5.times) than the sub transient time period. it is because the time constant of field winding circuit is much longer than damper winding circuit.\n\n(iii) steady state period: after transient period, the short circuit current reaches a steady state value isc it persists as long the circuit is not opened by some protective device.\n\nit is possible to observe the three periods of current if the rms value of ac component is plotted as a function of time on a semi log scale, as shown in fig. 6.93. accordingly, it is possible to determine the time constants tds and tdc from such a plot.\n\n\n6.43.1.sub transient, transient and direct reactance\n sub transient current is is the rms value of the initial current which occur at the instant of short circuit (i.e., oa\n\n2.) the corresponding value of reactance is known as direct axis sub transient reactance (xds).\n\n614.electrical machines the transient current envelope cuts the y axis at point b (see fig. 6.92). ic is the rms value of transient current (i.e., ob 2 ) and the corresponding value of reactance is called direct axis transient reactance (xdc).\n\nsimilarly, the rms value of the current represented by intercept oc (i.e., oc\n\n2.) is known as steady state short circuit current isc and the corresponding reactance is called the direct axis reactance xd.\n\nthus xds = e i\n\ne oa o\n\no\n\n\" =\n\n2\n\n...

so, the whole of input energy does not appear at the output but a part of it is lost in the form of heat in the surroundings. this wasted energy is called losses in the machine.\n\nthese losses affect the efficiency of the machine. a reduction in these losses leads to higher efficiency. thus, the major objective in the design of a synchronous machine is to reduce these losses.\n\nthe various losses occurring in a synchronous machine can be sub divided as:\n\n1.copper losses.\n\n2.iron losses.\n\n3.mechanical losses\n\n4.stray losses\n\n1.copper losses: the various windings of the synchronous machine such as armature and field winding are made of copper and have some resistance. when current flows through them, there will be power loss proportional to the square of their respective currents. these power losses are called copper losses.\n\nin general, the various copper losses in a synchronous machine are:\n\n(i) armature copper loss = i2r\n\n(ii) field winding copper loss = if\n\n2rf\n\n(iii) brush contact loss = i2rb the brush contact loss is generally included in field winding copper losses.\n\n2.iron losses: the losses which occur in the iron parts of the dc machine are called iron losses or core losses or magnetic losses. these losses consist of the following:\n\n(i) hysteresis loss: whenever a magnetic material is subjected to reversal of magnetic flux,\n\nthis loss occurs. it is due to retentivity (a property) of the magnetic material. it is expressed with reasonable accuracy by the following expression:\n\nph = kh v f bm\n\n1.6\n\n.\n\nwhere, kh =\n\nhysteresis constant in j/m3 i.e., energy loss per unit volume of magnetic material during one magnetic reversal, its value depends upon nature of material;\n\nv = volume of magnetic material in m3.\n\nf = frequency of magnetic reversal in cycle/second and bm = maximum flux density in the magnetic material in tesla.\n\nit occurs in the armature (stator core). to minimise this loss, the armature core is made of silicon steel which has low hysteresis constant.\n\n(ii) eddy current loss: when flux linking with the magnetic material changes (or flux is cut by the magnetic material) an emf is induced in it which circulates eddy currents through it. these eddy currents produce eddy current loss in the form of heat. it is expressed with reasonable accuracy by the expression:\n\npe = kevf\n\n2t2b2 m where, ke =\n\nconstant called co efficient of eddy current, its value depends upon the nature of magnetic material;\n\nt = thickness of lamination in m;\n\nv, f and bm are the same as above.\n\nsynchronous generators or alternators\n\n617.the major part of this loss occur in the armature core. to minimise this loss, the armature core is laminated into thin sheets (0*3 to 0*5 mm) since this loss is directly proportional to the square of thickness of the laminations.\n\n3.mechanical losses: as the field system of a synchronous machine is a rotating part, some power is required to overcome:\n\n(i) air friction of rotating field system (windage loss).\n\n(ii) friction at the bearing and friction between brushes and slip rings (friction loss).\n\nthese losses are known as mechanical losses. to reduce these losses proper lubrication is done at the bearings.\n\n4.stray losses. in addition to the iron losses, the core losses are also caused by distortion of the magnetic field under load conditions and losses in insulation of armature and field winding, these losses are called stray lasses. these losses are also included while determining the efficiency of synchronous machines.\n\nefficiency of a synchronous generator the ratio of output power to the input power of a synchronous generator is called its efficiency.\n\nefficiency, k = output input input losses input losses input\n\n=\n\n \n\n=\n\n \n\n1.also,\n\nk =\n\noutput output + losses\n\n6.45.power flow diagram the power flow diagram for a synchronous machine working as a generation is shown in fig. 6.94 fig. 6.94 power flow diagram\n\n6.46.necessity of cooling in the synchronous machine, following are the main losses;\n\n(i) copper losses\n\n(ii) iron losses\n\n(iii) mechanical losses.\n\nbecause of these losses heat is produced which increases the temperature of the machine. this rise in temperature deteriorates the dielectric strength and ability to withstand mechanical stresses of the insulation. thus it reduces the life of insulation on which life of machine depends. the rise in temperature further increases the losses and reduces the efficiency. hence the rise in temperature\n\n618.electrical machines is very harmful for the electrical machines. therefore, various means are adopted to dissipate this heat into the atmosphere and to reduce the temperature of machine. at a stage when the rate of heat production becomes equal to the rate of heat dissipation, final temperature is achieved. hence, to keep the temperature of the machine within the limits, efficient cooling method is necessary.\n\n6.47.methods of cooling cooling methods of synchronous machine are broadly divided into;\n\n(i) open circuit cooling (ii) closed circuit cooling\n\n(i) open circuit cooling: in an open circuit cooling system, a machine is cooled by the intake of cold air taken from atmosphere, which passes through the machine and is expelled into the atmosphere.\n\nto prevent clogging of the machine with dust which air always contains, a filter may be mounted at the air intake, but it must be frequently cleaned. however, the filter increases the resistance to air flow, requiring addition fan power.\n\nfig. 6.95 open circuit cooling in this method, fans are mounted on the rotor shaft which induces a stream of air flow into the machine. the air enters the machine from one side and leaves at the other. air flows axially and radially in the machine and cools it (see fig. 6.95). in bigger machines separate fans are driven by the independent motor are employed to circulate more air and improve the cooling efficiency.\n\n(ii) closed circuit cooling: the closed circuit cooling system is one in which the same volume of air passes through a closed circuit. it passes through the alternator, becomes heated, then it passes through air cooler, where it is cooled down and again circulated through the alternator by a forced fan as shown in fig.\n\n6.96.the air thus circulates in a closed system. the closed circuit cooling system is widely used with large synchronous generators.\n\nin closed circuit cooling system not only air, but also other gases may be used for cooling of large synchronous generators. at present hydrogen at a pressure of 3-4 atmosphere is mainly used.\n\nfig. 6.96 closed circuit cooling synchronous generators or alternators\n\n619.hydrogen cooling has a number of valuable advantages over air cooling as mentioned below;\n\n1.the heat conductivity of hydrogen is 7 times greater than that of air and as a result the surface heat transfer coefficient is 1*4 times greater than air. hydrogen, therefore, cools a machine more effectively and a machine of higher output can be built with smaller dimensions.\n\n2.hydrogen is 14 times lighter than air. hence, the windage losses, which in high speed machines make up the bulk of the total losses, decreases to about one tenth of the losses when air is used.\n\nthis results in the increase in efficiency of the machine.\n\n3.with the use of hydrogen, when the corona phenomena occurs ozone gas is not liberated to cause intense oxidation of the insulation. thus the service life of insulation is improved.\n\n6.48.preventive maintenance preventive maintenance and routine inspection techniques conserve and prolong the life of electric machinery. synchronous machines with general purpose ball or roller bearings require periodic lubrication while those equipped with self lubricating \"lifetime\" bearings require no lubrication at all. it may be noted that in lubricating electric machinery (synchronous machines), excessive oiling is just as damaging as insufficient lubrication. hence, periodic and appropriate lubrication is required.\n\nin synchronous machines, the brushes and sliprings also require periodic maintenance in addition to lubrication. the sliprings must be checked and cleaned periodically for dust sticking on its surface.\n\ncare must be taken that there should not be any type of oil leakage onto the stator. this may cause insulation breakdown of stator winding.\n\nthe body temperature and insulation temperature must be recorded frequently. its value must fall within the prescribed limits.\n\nsection practice problems numerical problems\n\n1.a three phase, 11kv 100 mva synchronous generator is

depends?\n\nintroduction to meet with the ever increasing demand of electrical power, it is economical and advisable to run number of generating units in parallel. although a single larger unit used to meet with the demand is more economical but it reduces the reliability. in fact, there are a number of good reasons to use number of smaller units operating in parallel to meet with the existing demand. in the present scenario, not only the number of units placed at one generating station are operated in parallel rather all the other units placed at the other generating stations which are interconnected are also operating in parallel with each other.\n\nin this chapter, we shall study different aspect of parallel operation of alternators or synchronous generators.\n\n7.1.necessity of parallel operation of alternators to meet with the demand of electrical power, a variety of generating stations hawing large capacity have been erected. in the modern generating stations, where huge power is generated, several alternators are operated in parallel.\n\nchapter"
